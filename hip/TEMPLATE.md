RULES
* Never place a link to an external site like Google Doc. The proposal should be in this issue entirely.
* Use a spelling and grammar checker tools if available for you (there are plenty of free ones).

PROPOSAL HEALTH CHECK
I can read the design document and understand the problem statement and what you plan to change *without* resorting to a couple of hours of code reading just to start having a high level understanding of the change.

IMAGES
If you need diagrams, avoid attaching large files. You can use [MermaidJS]([url](https://mermaid.js.org/)) as a simple language to describe many types of diagrams.
