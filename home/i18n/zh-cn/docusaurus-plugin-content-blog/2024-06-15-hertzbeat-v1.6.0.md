**Hi 朋友们，我们很高兴地宣布，Apache HertzBeat (incubating) 的了第一个Apache版本 v1.6.0 发布啦！🎉.**

经过近五个月的社区开发迭代贡献和两个月的Apache Incubator孵化过程，Apache HertzBeat (incubating) v1.6.0 终于出来了。
这个版本我们增加了对OpenAi监控，Redfish协议服务器，插件机制，支持了NebulaGraph, Apache Yarn, HDFS, Hbase, Storm等更多功能特性。
由于License兼容问题，我们在底层替换了ORM框架，计算框架等多个依赖，Hibernate -> EclipseLink, 这也算是JPA生态下为数不多的迁移踩坑实践。
同时修复了一些bug和优化了一些功能，更完善的文档。欢迎大家尝试使用，提出宝贵意见和建议，共同推动HertzBeat的发展。🎉

**当然，最重要的是给在社区的贡献者们致以最好的感谢！**

## 什么是 HertzBeat?

[Apache HertzBeat](https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat) （incubating）是一个易用友好的开源实时监控告警系统，无需 Agent，高性能集群，兼容 Prometheus，提供强大的自定义监控和状态页构建能力。

### 特点

- 集 **监控+告警+通知** 为一体，支持对应用服务，应用程序，数据库，缓存，操作系统，大数据，中间件，Web 服务器，云原生，网络，自定义等监控阈值告警通知一步到位。
- 易用友好，无需 `Agent`，全 `WEB` 页面操作，鼠标点一点就能监控告警，零上手学习成本。
- 将 `Http, Jmx, Ssh, Snmp, Jdbc, Prometheus` 等协议规范可配置化，只需在浏览器配置监控模版 `YML` 就能使用这些协议去自定义采集想要的指标。您相信只需配置下就能立刻适配一款 `K8s` 或 `Docker` 等新的监控类型吗？
- 兼容 `Prometheus` 的系统生态并且更多，只需页面操作就可以监控 `Prometheus` 所能监控的。
- 高性能，支持多采集器集群横向扩展，支持多隔离网络监控，云边协同。
- 自由的告警阈值规则，`邮件` `Discord` `Slack` `Telegram` `钉钉` `微信` `飞书` `短信` `Webhook` `Server酱` 等方式消息及时送达。
- 提供强大的状态页构建能力，轻松向用户传达您产品服务的实时状态。

> `HertzBeat`的强大自定义，多类型支持，高性能，易扩展，低耦合，希望能帮助用户快速搭建自有监控系统。
