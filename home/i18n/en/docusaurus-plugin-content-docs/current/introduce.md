## 🎡 <font color="green">Introduction</font>

> [HertzBeat](https://github.com/dromara/hertzbeat) is an open-source, real-time monitoring system with custom-monitor and agentless. Support web service, database, os, middleware and more.          
> We also provide **[Monitoring Cloud For Saas](https://console.tancloud.cn)**, people no longer need to deploy a cumbersome monitoring system in order to monitor their website resources. **[Sign in to get started for free](https://console.tancloud.cn)**.   
> HertzBeat supports more liberal threshold alarm configuration (calculation expression), supports alarm notification, alarm template, email, dingDing, weChat, feiShu, webhook and more.    
> Most important is HertzBeat supports [Custom Monitoring](https://hertzbeat.com/docs/advanced/extend-point), just by configuring the YML file, we can customize the monitoring types and metrics what we need.      
> HertzBeat is modular, `manager, collector, scheduler, warehouse, alerter` modules are decoupled for easy understanding and custom development.   
> Welcome to join us to build hertzbeat together.  

> `HertzBeat`'s multi-type support, easy expansion, low coupling, hope to help developers and micro teams to quickly build their own monitoring system.
