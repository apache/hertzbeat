title: Tutorial 2 Obtain TOKEN index value based on HTTP protocol for subsequent collection and authentication
sidebar_label: Tutorial 2 Get TOKEN for subsequent authentication
---

Through this tutorial, we will describe step by step how to modify on the basis of tutorial 1, add an indicator group, first call the authentication interface to obtain the TOKEN, and use the TOKEN as a parameter for the subsequent indicator group collection and authentication.

Before reading this tutorial, we hope that you are familiar with how to customize types, indicators, protocols, etc. from [Custom Monitoring] (extend-point) and [http Protocol Customization] (extend-http).

### Request process

【**Authentication information indicator group (highest priority)**】【**HTTP interface carries account password call**】->【**Response data analysis**】->【**Analysis and issuance of TOKEN-accessToken as an indicator **] -> [**Assign accessToken as a variable parameter to other collection index groups**]

> Here we still use the hertzbeat monitoring example of Tutorial 1! The hertzbeat background interface not only supports the basic direct account password authentication used in Tutorial 1, but also supports token authentication.

**We need `POST` to call the login interface `/api/account/auth/form` to get `accessToken`, the request body (json format) is as follows**:

```json
{
   "credential": "hertzbeat",
   "identifier": "admin"
}
```
**The response structure data is as follows**:

```json
{
   "data": {
     "token": "xxxx",
     "refreshToken": "xxxx"
   },
   "msg": null,
   "code": 0
}
```

### Add custom monitoring type `hertzbeat_token`

1. The custom monitoring type needs to add a new configuration YML file. We directly reuse the `hertzbeat` monitoring type in Tutorial 1 and modify it based on it

A monitoring configuration definition file named after the monitoring type - app-hertzbeat_token.yml needs to be located in the installation directory /hertzbeat/define/

The monitoring configuration definition file is used to define the collection type, which protocol collection method needs to be used, the collection indicators, protocol configuration parameters, etc.
We directly reuse the definition content in app-hertzbeat.yml and modify it to our current monitoring type `hertzbeat_auth` configuration parameters, such as `app, category, etc`.

```yaml
# This monitoring type belongs to the category: service-application service monitoring db-database monitoring custom-custom monitoring os-operating system monitoring
category: custom
# Monitoring application type (consistent with the file name) eg: linux windows tomcat mysql aws...
app: hertzbeat_token
name:
   en-GB: HertzBeat Monitoring (Token)
   en-US: Hertz Beat Monitor (Token)
params:
   # field - field name identifier
   - field: host
     # name - parameter field display name
     name:
       en-CN: Host Host
       en-US: Host
     # type-field type, style (mostly map input tag type attribute)
     type: host
     # Whether it is a required item true-required false-optional
     required: true
   - field: port
     name:
       en-CN: port
       en-US: Port
     type: number
     # When the type is number, use range to represent the range
     range: '[0,65535]'
     required: true
     # port default
     defaultValue: 1157
     # Parameter input box prompt information
     placeholder: 'Please enter the port'
   - field: ssl
     name:
       en-CN: Enable SSL
       en-US: SSL
     # When the type is boolean, the front end uses switch to display the switch
     type: boolean
     required: false
   - field: contentType
     name:
       en-CN: Content-Type
       en-US: Content-Type
     type: text
     placeholder: 'Request Body Type'
     required: false
   - field: payload
     name:
       en-CN: request BODY
       en-US: BODY
     type: textarea
     placeholder: 'Available When POST PUT'
     required: false
# Index group list configuration under todo
metrics: ....

```

### Define indicator group `auth` login request to get `token`

1. Add an index group definition `auth` in `app-hertzbeat_token.yml`, set the collection priority to the highest 0, and collect the index `token`.

```yaml

# This monitoring type belongs to the category: service-application service monitoring db-database monitoring custom-custom monitoring os-operating system monitoring
category: custom
# Monitoring application type (consistent with the file name) eg: linux windows tomcat mysql aws...
app: hertzbeat_token
name:
   en-GB: HertzBeat Monitoring (Token)
   en-US: Hertz Beat Monitor (Token)
params:
   # field - field name identifier
   - field: host
     # name - parameter field display name
     name:
       en-CN: Host Host
       en-US: Host
     # type-field type, style (mostly map input tag type attribute)
     type: host
     # Whether it is a required item true-required false-optional
     required: true
   - field: port
     name:
       en-CN: port
       en-US: Port
     type: number
     # When the type is number, use range to represent the range
     range: '[0,65535]'
     required: true
     # port default
     defaultValue: 1157
     # Parameter input box prompt information
     placeholder: 'Please enter the port'
   - field: ssl
     name:
       en-CN: Enable SSL
       en-US: SSL
     # When the type is boolean, the front end uses switch to display the switch
     type: boolean
     required: false
   - field: contentType
     name:
       en-CN: Content-Type
       en-US: Content-Type
     type: text
     placeholder: 'Request Body Type'
     required: false
   - field: payload
     name:
       en-CN: request BODY
       en-US: BODY
     type: textarea
     placeholder: 'Available When POST PUT'
     required: false
# List of indicator groups
metrics:
   # The first monitoring index group auth
   # Note: Built-in monitoring indicators have (responseTime - response time)
   - name: auth
     # The smaller the index group scheduling priority (0-127), the higher the priority, and the index group with low priority will not be scheduled until the collection of index groups with high priority is completed, and the index groups with the same priority will be scheduled and collected in parallel
     # The indicator group with priority 0 is the availability indicator group, that is, it will be scheduled first, and other indicator groups will continue to be scheduled if the collection is successful, and the scheduling will be interrupted if the collection fails
     priority: 0
     # Specific monitoring indicators in the indicator group
     fields:
       # Indicator information includes field name type field type: 0-number, 1-string whether instance is the primary key of the instance unit: indicator unit
       - field: token
         type: 1
       - field: refreshToken
         type: 1
     # Monitoring and collection protocol eg: sql, ssh, http, telnet, wmi, snmp, sdk
     protocol: http
     # When the protocol is the http protocol, the specific collection configuration
     http:
       host: ^_^host^_^
       # port
       port: ^_^port^_^
       # url request interface path
       url: /api/account/auth/form
       # Request method GET POST PUT DELETE PATCH
       method: POST
       # Whether to enable ssl/tls, that is, http or https, default false
       ssl: ^_^ssl^_^
       payload: ^_^payload^_^
       # request header content
       headers:
         content-type: ^_^contentType^_^
       # Response data analysis method: default-system rules, jsonPath-jsonPath script, website-website usability indicator monitoring
       parseType: jsonPath
       parseScript: '$.data'

```

**At this time, restart the hertzbeat system, add `hertzbeat_token` type monitoring on the system page, configure input parameters, `content-type` fill in `application/json`, `request Body` fill in the account password json as follows: **

```json
{
   "credential": "hertzbeat",
   "identifier": "admin"
}
```

** After the addition is successful, we can see the `token`, `refreshToken` indicator data we collected on the details page. **

### Use `token` as a variable parameter to collect and use the following indicator groups

**Add an index group definition `summary` in `app-hertzbeat_token.yml`, which is the same as `summary` in Tutorial 1, and set the collection priority to 1**

**Set the authentication method in the HTTP protocol configuration of this index group to `Bearer Token`, assign the index `token` collected by the previous index group `auth` as a parameter, and use `^o^` as the internal replacement symbol, that is ` ^o^token^o^`. as follows:**

```yaml
   - name: summary
# When the protocol is the http protocol, the specific collection configuration
     http:
       # authentication
       authorization:
         # Authentication methods: Basic Auth, Digest Auth, Bearer Token
         type: Bearer Token
         bearerTokenToken: ^o^token^o^
```

**The final `app-hertzbeat_token.yml` is defined as follows:**

```yaml

### Set threshold alarm notification

> Next, we can set the threshold normally. After the alarm is triggered, we can view it in the alarm center, add a new recipient, set alarm notification, etc. Have Fun!!!

#### over!

This is the end of the practice of custom monitoring of the HTTP protocol. The HTTP protocol also has other parameters such as headers and params. We can define it like postman, and the playability is also very high!

If you think hertzbeat is a good open source project, please give us a star on GitHub Gitee, thank you very much. Thanks for the old iron support. Refill!
