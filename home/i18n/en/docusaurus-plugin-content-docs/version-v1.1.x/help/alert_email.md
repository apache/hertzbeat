3. **Configure the associated alarm notification strategy⚠️ 【Add new notification strategy】-> 【Associate the recipient just set】-> 【Confirm】**

### Email notification common issues    

1. Hertzbeat deployed on its own intranet cannot receive email notifications   
> Hertzbeat needs to configure its own mail server, not tancloud. Please confirm whether you have configured its own mail server in application.yml     

2. Cloud environment tancloud cannot receive email notification  
> Please check whether there is any triggered alarm information in the alarm center.   
> Please check whether the mailbox is configured correctly and whether the alarm strategy association is configured.  
> Please check whether the warning email is blocked in the trash can of the mailbox.
