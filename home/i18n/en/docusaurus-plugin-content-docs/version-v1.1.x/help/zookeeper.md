> Collect and monitor the general performance Metrics of Zookeeper.

### PreRequisites

#### Zookeeper four word command
>The current implementation scheme uses the four word command provided by zookeeper to collect Metrics.
Users need to add the four word command of zookeeper to the white list by themselves.

Steps
> 1.Find our zookeeper configuration file, which is usually zoo.cfg.
>
> 2.Add the following commands to the configuration file

```shell
# Add the required command to the white list
4lw.commands.whitelist=stat, ruok, conf, isro

# Add all commands to the white list
4lw.commands.whitelist=*
```

> 3.Restart service

```shell 
zkServer.sh restart
```

#### netcat protocol
The current implementation scheme requires us to deploy the Linux server of zookeeper
Command environment for installing netcat

> netcat installation steps
```shell
yum install -y nc
```

If the terminal displays the following information, the installation is successful
