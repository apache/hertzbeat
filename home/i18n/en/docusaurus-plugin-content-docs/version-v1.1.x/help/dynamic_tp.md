> Collect and monitor the thread pool performance Metrics exposed by DynamicTp actuator.

### PreRequisites

1. Integration Using `DynamicTp`

`DynamicTp` is a lightweight dynamic thread pool based on the configuration center of the Jvm language. It has built-in monitoring and alarm functions, which can be realized through SPI custom extensions.

For integrated use, please refer to the document [Quick Start](https://dynamictp.cn/guide/use/quick-start.html)

2. Open SpringBoot Actuator Endpoint to expose `DynamicTp` Metric interface

```yaml
management:
   endpoints:
     web:
       exposure:
         include: '*'
```
Test whether the access Metric interface `ip:port/actuator/dynamic-tp` has response json data as follows:

```json
[
   {
     "poolName": "commonExecutor",
     "corePoolSize": 1,
     "maximumPoolSize": 1,
     "queueType": "LinkedBlockingQueue",
     "queueCapacity": 2147483647,
     "queueSize": 0,
     "fair": false,
     "queueRemainingCapacity": 2147483647,
     "activeCount": 0,
     "taskCount": 0,
     "completedTaskCount": 0,
     "largestPoolSize": 0,
     "poolSize": 0,
     "waitTaskCount": 0,
     "rejectCount": 0,
     "rejectHandlerName": null,
     "dynamic": false,
     "runTimeoutCount": 0,
     "queueTimeoutCount": 0
   },
   {
     "maxMemory": "4GB",
     "totalMemory": "444MB",
     "freeMemory": "250.34 MB",
     "usableMemory": "3.81GB"
   }
]
```

3. Add DynamicTp monitoring under HertzBeat middleware monitoring


### Configuration parameters

| Parameter name | Parameter help description |
| ------------ |------------------------------------ ------------------|
| Monitoring Host | The peer IPV4, IPV6 or domain name to be monitored. Note ⚠️Without protocol header (eg: https://, http://). |
| Monitoring name | The name that identifies this monitoring, and the name needs to be unique. |
| Port | The port provided by the application service, the default is 8080. |
| Enable HTTPS | Whether to access the website through HTTPS, note ⚠️Enable HTTPS, the default corresponding port needs to be changed to 443 |
| Base Path | Exposed interface path prefix, default /actuator |
| Acquisition Interval | Interval time for monitoring periodic data collection, in seconds, the minimum interval that can be set is 30 seconds |
| Whether to detect | Whether to detect and check the availability of monitoring before adding monitoring, and the operation of adding and modifying will continue after the detection is successful |
| Description Remarks | More remark information to identify and describe this monitoring, users can remark information here |
