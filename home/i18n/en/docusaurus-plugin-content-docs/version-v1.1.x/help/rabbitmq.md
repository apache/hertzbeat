> Monitoring the running status of RabbitMQ message middleware, nodes, topics and other related metrics.

### Pre-monitoring Operations  

> HertzBeat uses RabbitMQ Management's Rest Api to collect RabbitMQ metric data.
> Therefore, you need to enable the Management plug-in in your RabbitMQ environment

1. Open the Management plugin, or use the self-opening version

```shell
rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
```

2. Access http://ip:15672/ with a browser, and the default account password is `guest/guest`. Successful login means that it is successfully opened.

3. Just add the corresponding RabbitMQ monitoring in HertzBeat, the parameters use the IP port of Management, and the default account password.
