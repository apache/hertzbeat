#### Supported Environment Variables

> Environment variables refer to variables supported by metric values, used in expressions. During threshold calculation and judgment, these variables will be replaced with actual values.

Non-fixed Environment Variables: These variables change dynamically based on the selected monitoring metric. For example, if we choose **response time metric for website monitoring**, the environment variable would be `responseTime - this represents response time variable`. If we want to set an alert trigger for **response time greater than 400 for website monitoring**, the expression would be `responseTime>400`.

Fixed Environment Variables (Less commonly used): `instance: instance value`
This variable is mainly used for calculations involving multiple instances. For instance, if we collect usage metrics for C drive and D drive (`usage` being a non-fixed environment variable), and we only want to set an alert for **usage greater than 80 for the C drive**, the expression would be `equals(instance,"c")&&usage>80`.

#### Expression Configuration Examples

1. Website Monitoring -> Alert when response time is greater than or equal to 400ms
   `responseTime>=400`
2. API Monitoring -> Alert when response time is greater than 3000ms
   `responseTime>3000`
3. Overall Monitoring -> Alert when response time for URL (instance) path '<https://baidu.com/book/3>' is greater than 200ms
   `equals(instance,"https://baidu.com/book/3")&&responseTime>200`
4. MYSQL Monitoring -> Alert when 'threads_running' metric under 'status' exceeds 7
   `threads_running>7`
