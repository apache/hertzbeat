### Collection Metric

Since there are too many metrics that can be queried on Huawei switches, detailed metrics can be queried
on [Huawei MIB Query Platform](https://info.support.huawei.com/info-finder/tool/en/enterprise/mib).

This document only introduces the monitoring indicators queried in the monitor template.

This string should include the name of the manufacturer, the product name and the version of the interface hardware/software.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ifMtu         | octets      | The size of the largest packet which can be sent/received on the interface. For interfaces that are used for transmitting network datagrams, this is the size of the largest network datagram that can be sent on the interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ifSpeed       | bit/s       | An estimate of the interface's current bandwidth. For interfaces which do not vary in bandwidth or for those where no accurate estimation can be made, this object should contain the nominal bandwidth. If the bandwidth of the interface is greater than the maximum value reportable by this object then this object should report its maximum value (4,294,967,295) and ifHighSpeed must be used to report the interace's speed. For a sub-layer which has no concept of bandwidth, this object should be zero.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ifInOctets    | octets      | The total number of octets received on the interface, including framing characters.

| ifInDiscards  | none        | The number of inbound packets which were chosen to be discarded even though no errors had been detected to prevent their being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. One possible reason for discarding such a packet could be to free up buffer space. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

For character-oriented or fixed-length interfaces, the number of inbound transmission units that contained errors preventing them from being deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ifOutOctets   | octets      | The total number of octets transmitted out of the interface, including framing characters. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ifOutDiscards | none        | The number of outbound packets which were chosen to be discarded even though no errors had been detected to prevent their being transmitted. One possible reason for discarding such a packet could be to free up buffer space. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ifOutErrors   | none        | For packet-oriented interfaces, the number of outbound packets that could not be transmitted because of errors. For character-oriented or fixed-length interfaces, the number of outbound transmission units that could not be transmitted because of errors. Discontinuities in the value of this counter can occur at re-initialization of the management system, and at other times as indicated by the value of ifCounterDiscontinuityTime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ifAdminStatus | none        | The desired state of the interface. The testing(3) state indicates that no operational packets can be passed. When a managed system initializes, all interfaces start with ifAdminStatus in the down(2) state. As a result of either explicit management action or per configuration information retained by the managed system, ifAdminStatus is then changed to either the up(1) or testing(3) states (or remains in the down(2) state).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ifOperStatus  | none        | The current operational state of the interface. The testing(3) state indicates that no operational packets can be passed. If ifAdminStatus is down(2) then ifOperStatus should be down(2). If ifAdminStatus is changed to up(1) then ifOperStatus should change to up(1) if the interface is ready to transmit and receive network traffic; it should change to dormant(5) if the interface is waiting for external actions (such as a serial line waiting for an incoming connection); it should remain in the down(2) state if and only if there is a fault that prevents it from going to the up(1) state; it should remain in the notPresent(6) state if the interface has missing (typically, hardware) components. |
