title: How to Release
sidebar_position: 4
---

This tutorial describes in detail how to release Apache HertzBeat, take the release of version 1.6.0 as an example.

## 1. Environmental requirements

This release process is operated in the UbuntuOS(Windows,Mac), and the following tools are required:

- JDK 17
- Node18 Yarn
- Apache Maven 3.x
- GnuPG 2.x
- Git
- SVN (apache uses svn to host project releases)

> Pay attention to setting environment variables `export GPG_TTY=$(tty)`

## 2. Preparing for release

> First summarize the account information to better understand the operation process, will be used many times later.
>
> - apache id: `muchunjin (APACHE LDAP UserName)`
> - apache passphrase: `APACHE LDAP Passphrase`
> - apache email: `muchunjin@apache.org`
> - gpg real name: `muchunjin (Any name can be used, here I set it to the same name as the apache id)`
> - gpg key passphrase: `The password set when creating the gpg key, you need to remember this password`

### 2.1 Key generation

```shell
$ gpg --full-gen-key
gpg (GnuPG) 2.2.27; Copyright (C) 2021 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.

Please select what kind of key you want:
(1) RSA and RSA (default)
(2) DSA and Elgamal
(3) DSA (sign only)
(4) RSA (sign only)
(14) Existing key from card
Your selection? 1 # Please enter 1
RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
What keysize do you want? (3072) 4096 # Please enter 4096 here
Requested keysize is 4096 bits
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
0 = key does not expire
<n> = key expires in n days
<n>w = key expires in n weeks
<n>m = key expires in n months
<n>y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0) 0 # Please enter 0
Key does not expire at all
Is this correct? (y/N) y # Please enter y here

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: muchunjin # Please enter 'gpg real name'
Email address: muchunjin@apache.org # Please enter your apache email address here
Comment: apache key # Please enter some comments here
You selected this USER-ID:
    "muchunjin (apache key) <muchunjin@apache.org>"

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O # Please enter O here
We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

# At this time, a dialog box will pop up, asking you to enter the key for this gpg. 
# you need to remember that it will be used in subsequent steps.
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

public and secret key created and signed.

pub   rsa4096 2023-05-01 [SC]
      85778A4CE4DD04B7E07813ABACFB69E705016886
uid                      muchunjin (apache key) <muchunjin@apache.org>
sub   rsa4096 2023-05-01 [E]
```

Keys can be viewed through the `gpg --list-signatures` command

### 2.2 Upload the generated key to the public server

```shell
$ gpg --keyid-format SHORT --list-keys
/root/.gnupg/pubring.kbx
------------------------
pub   rsa4096/05016886 2023-05-01 [SC]
      85778A4CE4DD04B7E07813ABACFB69E705016886
uid         [ultimate] muchunjin (apache key) <muchunjin@apache.org>
sub   rsa4096/0C5A4E1C 2023-05-01 [E]

# Send public key to keyserver via key id
$ gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --send-key 05016886
# Among them, keyserver.ubuntu.com is the selected keyserver, it is recommended to use this, because the Apache Nexus verification uses this keyserver
```

#### 2.3 Check if the key is created successfully

Verify whether it is synchronized to the public network, it will take about a minute to find out the answer, if not successful, you can upload and retry multiple times.

```shell
$ gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 05016886   # If the following content appears, it means success
gpg: key ACFB69E705016886: "muchunjin (apache key) <muchunjin@apache.org>" not changed
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:              unchanged: 1
```

Or enter <https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/> address in the browser, enter the name of the key and click 'Search key' to search if existed.

#### 2.4 Add the gpg public key to the KEYS file of the Apache SVN project repo

- Apache HertzBeat Branch Dev <https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/hertzbeat>
- Apache HertzBeat Branch Release <https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/incubator/hertzbeat>

##### 2.4.1 Add public key to KEYS in dev branch

```shell
$ mkdir -p svn/dev
$ cd svn/dev

$ svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/hertzbeat
$ cd svn/dev/hertzbeat

# Append the KEY you generated to the file KEYS, and check if it is added correctly
$ (gpg --list-sigs muchunjin@apache.org && gpg --export --armor muchunjin@apache.org) >> KEYS 

$ svn ci -m "add gpg key for muchunjin"
```

##### 2.4.2 Add public key to KEYS in release branch

```shell
$ mkdir -p svn/release
$ cd svn/release

$ svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/incubator/hertzbeat
$ cd svn/release/hertzbeat

# Append the KEY you generated to the file KEYS, and check if it is added correctly
$ (gpg --list-sigs muchunjin@apache.org && gpg --export --armor muchunjin@apache.org) >> KEYS 

$ svn ci -m "add gpg key for muchunjin"
```

## 3. Prepare material package & release

### Build Package

#### 3.1 Based on the master branch, create a release-${release_version}-rcx branch, such as release-1.6.0-rc1, And create a tag named v1.6.0-rc1 based on the release-1.6.0-rc1 branch, and set this tag as pre-release

```shell
git checkout master
git checkout -b release-1.6.0-rc1
```

#### 3.2 checkout release branch to local

```shell
git checkout release-1.6.0-rc1
```

#### 3.3 Compile the binary package

> Build HertzBeat server binary, run script in `web-app`

```shell
yarn install

yarn package
```

> run script in root

```shell
mvn clean package -Prelease
```

then

```shell
mvn clean install
```

> Build HertzBeat collector binary, run script in `collector`

```shell
mvn clean package -Pcluster
```

The release package are here:

- `dist/apache-hertzbeat-{version}-incubating-bin.tar.gz`
- `dist/apache-hertzbeat-collector-{version}-incubating-bin.tar.gz`

#### 3.4 Package the source code

> Package the project source code

```shell
git archive \
--format=tar.gz \
--output="dist/apache-hertzbeat-1.6.0-incubating-src.tar.gz" \
--prefix=apache-hertzbeat-1.6.0-incubating-src/ \
release-1.6.0-rc1
```

The archive package is here `dist/apache-hertzbeat-1.6.0-incubating-src.tar.gz`

### Sign package

#### 3.5 Sign binary and source packages

> The `gpg -u 33545C76`  `33545C76` is your gpg secret ID, see from `gpg --keyid-format SHORT --list-keys`

```shell
cd dist

# sign
for i in *.tar.gz; do echo $i; gpg -u 33545C76 --armor --output $i.asc --detach-sig $i ; done

# SHA512
for i in *.tar.gz; do echo $i; sha512sum $i > $i.sha512 ; done

# if macos sha512sum not found, you can install by brew install coreutils
```

> The final file list is as follows

```properties
apache-hertzbeat-1.6.0-incubating-src.tar.gz
apache-hertzbeat-1.6.0-incubating-src.tar.gz.asc
apache-hertzbeat-1.6.0-incubating-src.tar.gz.sha512
apache-hertzbeat-1.6.0-incubating-bin.tar.gz
apache-hertzbeat-1.6.0-incubating-bin.tar.gz.asc
apache-hertzbeat-1.6.0-incubating-bin.tar.gz.sha512
apache-hertzbeat-collector-1.6.0-incubating-bin.tar.gz
apache-hertzbeat-collector-1.6.0-incubating-bin.tar.gz.asc
apache-hertzbeat-collector-1.6.0-incubating-bin.tar.gz.sha512
```

#### 3.6 Verify signature

```shell
$ cd dist

# Verify signature
$ for i in *.tar.gz; do echo $i; gpg --verify $i.asc $i ; done

apache-hertzbeat-1.6.0-incubating-src.tar.gz
gpg: Signature made Tue May  2 12:16:35 2023 CST

gpg: BAD signature from "muchunjin (apache key) <muchunjin@apache.org>" [ultimate]

# Verify SHA512
$ for i in *.tar.gz; do echo $i; sha512sum --check $i.sha512; done

apache-hertzbeat-1.6.0-incubating-src.tar.gz
apache-hertzbeat-1.6.0-incubating-src.tar.gz: OK
apache-hertzbeat-1.6.0-incubating-bin.tar.gz
apache-hertzbeat-1.6.0-incubating-bin.tar.gz: OK
apache-hertzbeat-collector-1.6.0-incubating-bin.tar.gz
apache-hertzbeat-collector-1.6.0-incubating-bin.tar.gz: OK
```

#### 3.7 Publish the dev directory of the Apache SVN material package

- Clone the dev directory

```shell
# Check out the dev directory of the Apache SVN to the svn/dev directory under dist in the root directory of the Apache HertzBeat project
svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/hertzbeat svn/dev

svn co --depth empty https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/hertzbeat
```

- Copy the material package to the dev directory

Create a version number directory and name it in the form of ${release_version}-${RC_version}. RC_version starts from 1, that is, the candidate version starts from RC1. During the release process, there is a problem that causes the vote to fail.  
If it needs to be corrected, it needs to iterate the RC version , the RC version number needs to be +1. For example: Vote for version 1.6.0-RC1. If the vote passes without any problems, the RC1 version material will be released as the final version material.  
If there is a problem (when the hertzbeat/incubator community votes, the voters will strictly check various release requirements and compliance issues) and need to be corrected, then re-initiate the vote after the correction, and the candidate version for the next vote is 1.6.0- RC2.

```shell
mkdir -p svn/dev/1.6.0-RC1
cp -f dist/* svn/dev/1.6.0-RC1
```

- Commit to SVN

```shell
cd svn/dev

# 1.check svn status
svn status

# 2. add to svn
svn add 1.6.0-RC1

svn status

# 3. Submit to svn remote server
svn commit -m "release for HertzBeat 1.6.0"
```

- Check Apache SVN Commit Results

> Visit the address <https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/hertzbeat/1.6.0-RC1/> in the browser, check if existed the new material package

## 4. Enter the community voting stage
