4. **Configure the associated alarm notification strategy⚠️ [Add notification strategy] -> [Associate the recipient just set] -> [OK]**

### Discord Bot Notification FAQ   

1. Discord doesn't receive bot alert notifications   

> Please check whether the alarm information has been triggered in the alarm center   
> Please check whether the robot Token and ChannelId are configured correctly, and whether the alarm policy association has been configured   
> Please check whether the bot is properly authorized by the Discord chat server
