### Getting HertzBeat up and running

> To get HertzBeat code running on your development tools, and able to debug with breakpoints.   
> This is a front-end and back-end separation project. To start the local code, the back-end manager and the front-end web-app must be started separately.


#### Backend start

1. Requires `maven3+`, `java17` and `lombok` environments

2. (Optional) Modify the configuration file: `manager/src/main/resources/application.yml`

3. Execute under the project root directory: `mvn clean install -DskipTests`

4. Start `springboot manager` service: `manager/src/main/java/org/apache/hertzbeat/manager/Manager.java`

#### Frontend start

1. Need `Node Yarn` Environment, Make sure `Node.js >= 18`

2. Cd to the `web-app` directory: `cd web-app`

3. Install yarn if not existed `npm install -g yarn`

4. Install Dependencies: `yarn install` or `yarn install --registry=https://registry.npmmirror.com` in `web-app`

5. Install angular-cli globally: `yarn global add @angular/cli@15` or `yarn global add @angular/cli@15 --registry=https://registry.npmmirror.com`

6. After the local backend is started, start the local frontend in the web-app directory: `ng serve --open`

7. Browser access to localhost:4200 to start, default account/password is *admin/hertzbeat*

### Find tasks

Find the issue you are interested in! On our GitHub repo issue list, we often publish some issues with the label good first issue or status: volunteer wanted.
These issues welcome the help of contributors. Among them, good first issues tend to have low thresholds and are suitable for novices.

Of course, if you have a good idea, you can also propose it directly on GitHub Discussion or contact with community.

### Submit Pull Request

1. First you need to fork your target [hertzbeat repository](https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat).
2. Then download the code locally with git command:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:${YOUR_USERNAME}/hertzbeat.git #Recommended  
```
3. After the download is complete, please refer to the getting started guide or README file of the target repository to initialize the project.
4. Then, you can refer to the following command to submit the code:
```shell
git checkout -b a-feature-branch #Recommended  
```
5. Submit the coed as a commit, the commit message format specification required: [module name or type name]feature or bugfix or doc: custom message.
```shell
git add <modified file/path> 
git commit -m '[docs]feature: necessary instructions' #Recommended 
```
6. Push to the remote repository
```shell
git push origin a-feature-branch   
```
7. Then you can initiate a new PR (Pull Request) on GitHub.

Please note that the title of the PR needs to conform to our spec, and write the necessary description in the PR to facilitate code review by Committers and other contributors.

### Wait for the code to be merged

After submitting the PR, the Committee or the community's friends will review the code you submitted (Code Review), and will propose some modification suggestions or conduct some discussions. Please pay attention to your PR in time.

If subsequent changes are required, there is no need to initiate a new PR. After submitting a commit on the original branch and pushing it to the remote repository, the PR will be automatically updated.

In addition, our project has a relatively standardized and strict CI inspection process. After submitting PR, CI will be triggered. Please pay attention to whether it passes the CI inspection.

Finally, the Committers can merge the PR into the master branch.

### After the code is merged

After the code has been merged, you can delete the development branch on both the local and remote repositories:

```shell
git branch -d a-dev-branch
git push origin --delete a-dev-branch
```

On the master/main branch, you can do the following to sync the upstream repository:

```shell
git remote add upstream https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat.git #Bind the remote warehouse, if it has been executed, it does not need to be executed again
git checkout master 
git pull upstream master
```

### HertzBeat Improvement Proposal (HIP)
If you have major new features(e.g., support metrics push gateway, support logs monitoring), you need to write a design document known as a HertzBeat Improvement Proposal (HIP). Before starting to write a HIP, make sure you follow the process [here](https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/tree/master/hip).
