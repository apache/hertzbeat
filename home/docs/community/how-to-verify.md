# Verify the candidate version

For detailed check list, please refer to the official [check list](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INCUBATOR/Incubator+Release+Checklist)

## 1. Download the candidate version

Download the candidate version to be released to the local environment Need to rely on gpg tool, if not, it is recommended to install `gpg2`.

:::caution

If the network is poor, downloading may be time-consuming. The download is completed normally in about 20 minutes, please wait patiently.

:::

```shell
#If there is svn locally, you can clone to the local
$ svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/hertzbeat/${release_version}-${rc_version}/
#or download the material file directly
$ wget https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/hertzbeat/${release_version}-${rc_version}/xxx.xxx
```

## 2. Verify that the uploaded version is compliant

Start the verification process, which includes but is not limited to the following content and forms.

### 2.1 Check whether the release package is complete

The package uploaded to dist must include the source code package, and the binary package is optional.

1. Whether to include the source code package
2. Whether to include the signature of the source code package
3. Whether to include the sha512 of the source code package
4. If the binary package is uploaded, also check the contents listed in (2)-(4)


### 2.2 Check gpg signature

First import the publisher's public key. Import KEYS from the svn repository to the local environment. (The person who releases the version does not need to import it again, the person who helps to do the verification needs to import it, and the user name is enough for the person who issued the version)

#### 2.2.1 Import public key

```shell
$ curl  https://downloads.apache.org/incubator/hertzbeat/KEYS > KEYS # Download KEYS
$ gpg --import KEYS # Import KEYS to local
```
#### 2.2.2 Trust the public key

Trust the KEY used in this version:

```shell
$ gpg --edit-key xxxxxxxxxx #KEY user used in this version
gpg (GnuPG) 2.2.21; Copyright (C) 2020 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.

Secret key is available.
gpg> trust #trust
Please decide how far you trust this user to correctly verify other users' keys
(by looking at passports, checking fingerprints from different sources, etc.)

  1 = I don't know or won't say
  2 = I do NOT trust
  3 = I trust marginally
  4 = I trust fully
  5 = I trust ultimately
  m = back to the main menu

Your decision? 5 #choose 5
Do you really want to set this key to ultimate trust? (y/N) y  #choose y
                                                            
gpg>
         
```

#### 2.2.3 Check the gpg signature

```shell
$ for i in *.tar.gz; do echo $i; gpg --verify $i.asc $i; done
```

check result

> If something like the following appears, it means the signature is correct. Keyword: **`Good signature`**

```shell
apache-hertzbeat-xxx-incubating-src.tar.gz
gpg: Signature made XXXX
gpg: using RSA key XXXXX
gpg: Good signature from "xxx @apache.org>"
```

### 2.3 Check sha512 hash

```shell
$ for i in *.tar.gz; do echo $i; sha512sum --check  $i.sha512; done
```

### 2.4 Check the binary package

unzip  `apache-hertzbeat-${release.version}-incubating-bin.tar.gz`

```shell
tar -xzvf apache-hertzbeat-${release.version}-incubating-bin.tar.gz
```

check as follows:

- [ ] Check whether the source package contains unnecessary files, which makes the tar package too large
- [ ] Folder contains the word `incubating`
- [ ] There are `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` files
- [ ] There is a `DISCLAIMER` or `DISCLAIMER-WIP` file
- [ ] The year in the `NOTICE` file is correct
- [ ] Only text files exist, not binary files
- [ ] All files have ASF license at the beginning
- [ ] Able to compile correctly
- [ ] Check for extra files or folders, such as empty folders, etc.
- [ ] .....



### 2.5 Check the source package

> If the binary/web-binary package is uploaded, check the binary package.

Unzip `apache-hertzbeat-${release_version}-incubating-src.tar.gz`

```shell
cd apache-hertzbeat-${release_version}-incubating-src
```

compile the source code: [Build HertzBeat Binary Package](https://hertzbeat.apache.org/docs/community/development/#build-hertzbeat-binary-package)

and check as follows:

- [ ] There are `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` files
- [ ] There is a `DISCLAIMER` or `DISCLAIMER-WIP` file
- [ ] The year in the `NOTICE` file is correct
- [ ] All text files have ASF license at the beginning
- [ ] Check the third-party dependent license:
- [ ] Compatible with third-party dependent licenses
- [ ] All third-party dependent licenses are named in the `LICENSE` file
- [ ] If you are relying on the Apache license and there is a `NOTICE` file, then these `NOTICE` files also need to be added to the version of the `NOTICE` file
- [ ] .....
