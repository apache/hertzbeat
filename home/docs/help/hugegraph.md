> Collect and monitor the general performance metrics of HugeGraph

**Protocol used: HTTP**

## Pre-monitoring Operations

Check the `rest-server.properties` file to obtain the value of the `restserver_port` configuration item, which is used for monitoring.

## Configuration Parameters


| Parameter Name   | Parameter Description                                      |
