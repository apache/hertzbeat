### Introduction

HertzBeat supports using expressions to calculate relative time during monitoring collection, allowing for more flexible time definitions in monitoring templates.

### Syntax

```shell
${FORMATTER [{ + | - }<DURATION> <TIME_UNIT>]}
```

- `FORMATTER`: Determines the format of the expression's result
- `DURATION`: Size of the time period, a positive integer
- `TIME_UNIT`: Unit of the time period

### Supported Formatting Types

> Example outputs are based on the current time being `2022-04-24 02:40:00.123`

#### Where to Use

- Request parameters for HTTP protocol monitoring types

#### Usage Examples

1. Simple expression
   - `${now}` gets the current time and formats it as `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss`
   - `${time+1h}` calculates the time one hour from now and formats it as `HH:mm:ss`
   - `${time+1h+15s+30s}` calculates the time one hour, 15 minutes, and 30 seconds from now and formats it as `HH:mm:ss`
2. Complex expression template (if the built-in formatter does not meet your needs, you can combine multiple expressions)
   - `${@year}年${@month}月${@day}日` returns the current date formatted as yyyy年MM月dd日
