> Collect and monitor the general performance Metrics of nebulaGraph.

**Protocol Use：nebulaGraph**

```text
The monitoring has two parts,nebulaGraph_stats and rocksdb_stats.
nebulaGraph_stats is nebulaGraph's statistics, and rocksdb_stats is rocksdb's statistics.
```

###           

**1、Obtain available parameters through the stats and rocksdb stats interfaces.**

1.1、 If you only need to get nebulaGraph_stats, you need to ensure that you have access to stats, or you'll get errors.

The default port is 19669 and the access address is http://ip:19669/stats

1.2、If you need to obtain additional parameters for rocksdb stats, you need to ensure that you have access to rocksdb
stats, otherwise an error will be reported.

Once you connect to NebulaGraph for the first time, you must first register your Storage service in order to properly
query your data.

**https://docs.nebula-graph.com.cn/3.4.3/2.quick-start/3.quick-start-on-premise/3.1add-storage-hosts/**

The default port is 19779 and the access address is:http://ip:19779/rocksdb_stats
