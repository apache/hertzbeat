## SMS Service Configuration

Only when you successfully configure your own SMS service will the alert SMS triggered within the monitoring system be sent correctly.  
HertzBeat provides two ways to configure the SMS service: modifying the `application.yml` configuration file directly or configuring it through the HertzBeat frontend interface (Settings > Message Server Setting).

> ⚠️ Note: Only one method can be effective at a time. If both methods are configured and enabled, HertzBeat will prioritize the SMS service configured in the frontend interface.

## Operation steps

1. **【Alarm notification】->【Add new recipient】 ->【Select SMS notification method】**

2. **Configure the associated alarm notification strategy⚠️ 【Add new notification strategy】-> 【Associate the recipient just set】-> 【Confirm】**

   > **Note⚠️ Adding a new recipient does not mean that it is effective to receive alarm information. It is also necessary to configure the associated alarm notification strategy, that is, to specify which messages are sent to which recipients.**
