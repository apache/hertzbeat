| Monitoring Host     | Monitored IPV4, IPV6 or domain name. Note⚠️Without protocol header (eg: https://, http://)                                                                                |
| Monitoring name     | Identify the name of this monitoring. The name needs to be unique                                                                                                         |
| Collection interval | Interval time of monitor periodic data collection, unit: second, and the minimum interval that can be set is 30 seconds                                                   |
| Whether to detect   | Whether to detect and check the availability of monitoring before adding monitoring. Adding and modifying operations will continue only after the detection is successful |
