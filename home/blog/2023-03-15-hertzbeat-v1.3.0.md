### What is HertzBeat?

> HertzBeat is an open source real-time monitoring and alerting tool with powerful custom monitoring capabilities and no Agent required.     
> It supports monitoring of application services, database, operating system, middleware, cloud native, network and other metrics, and threshold alert notification in one step.   
> Support more liberal threshold rules (calculation expressions), `email` `Discord` `Slack` `Telegram` `Pegging` `WeChat` `FlyBook` `SMS` `Webhook` and other ways to timely delivery.

> We have made the protocol specifications such as `Http, Jmx, Ssh, Snmp, Jdbc, Prometheus` configurable so that you can simply configure `YML` to use these protocols to customize the collection of any metrics you want.

> Do you believe that you can immediately adapt a new monitoring type such as K8s or Docker just by defining YML?

- **Support for monitoring redis clusters and more database metrics**.   
Community contributors have contributed extended metrics for redis clusters and multiple databases, enriching the performance metrics data.

- **Support iotdb1.0 storage, dependency-free mode**   
and more new features welcome to explore

- Fix several bugs, better documentation, refactored code.

Only one docker command is needed to install and experience heartbeat

`docker run -d -p 1157:1157 --name hertzbeat tancloud/hertzbeat`

Thanks to the hertzbeat contributors for their contributions! üëçüëçüëç

We are in desperate need of contributors for various aspects of test cases, new application monitoring, documentation, etc. Contributors are very welcome to join.

Upgrade note ‚ö†Ô∏è.

For users who previously used iotdb or tdengine to store metrics data, you need to modify application.yml to disable JPA storage `warehouse.store.jpa.enabled` as follows:

Modify `application.yml` and set `warehouse.store.jpa.enabled` parameter to false   

```
warehouse:
  store:
    jpa:
      enabled: false
```

Execute SQL script

```
ALTER table hzb_monitor modify job_id bigint default null;
COMMIT;
```
