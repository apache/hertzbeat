### What is HertzBeat?

> [HertzBeat](https://github.com/dromara/hertzbeat) is an open source, real-time monitoring system with custom-monitoring and agentLess.
> **Monitoring+Alarm+Notify** all in one. Support monitoring web service, database, os, middleware, cloud-native, network and more.      
> Easy to use, full web-based operation, monitoring and alerting at the click of a mouse, zero learning cost.     
> More flexible threshold rule, timely notification delivery by `Discord` `Slack` `Telegram` `Email` `DingDing` `WeChat` `FeiShu` `Webhook` `SMS`.

> We make protocols such as `Http, Jmx, Ssh, Snmp, Jdbc` configurable, and you only need to configure `YML` online to collect any metrics you want.     
> Do you believe that you can immediately adapt a new monitoring type such as K8s or Docker just by configuring online?

> `HertzBeat`'s powerful custom-define, multi-type support, easy expansion, low coupling, hope to help developers and micro teams to quickly build their own monitoring system.     
> We also provide **[Monitoring SaaS Cloud](https://console.tancloud.cn)**, users no longer need to deploy a cumbersome monitoring system in order to monitor resources. **[Get started for free](https://console.tancloud.cn)**.

### v1.3.2 

Hi guys! Major release. HertzBeat v1.3.2 has published.   

**This delightful version came out of the hard work of 27 friends. Thank them! Love üíó**

In this version, we support new monitoring types and indicators for **freebsd, debian, opensuse, redhat, apache doris**, etc.

- Support WEB page configuration mail server, replace the previous file configuration
- Supports alarm convergence. If repeated alarms are frequently sent, it will be resolved immediately with alarm convergence
- The public message queue supports Kafka. In addition to our default built-in memory message queue, it also supports an external Kafka message queue to improve system performance.
- The new monitoring center page aggregates all monitoring types, no need to switch back and forth like before.
- Support label group display, group and mark monitors of the same business category for unified management.
- Threshold configuration not only has expressions, but also supports a more user-friendly operation UI. The previous expressions were not friendly to newcomers and were prone to errors. Now you can directly operate the UI, and it can switch between expressions.
- There are many more functions such as HTTP ipv6.

Fixed a large number of BUG, improved the document code, and improved the overall stability and usability. More new features are welcome to explore!
