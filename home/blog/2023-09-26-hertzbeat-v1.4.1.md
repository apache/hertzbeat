### What is HertzBeat?

[HertzBeat](https://github.com/dromara/hertzbeat) is an open source, real-time monitoring system with custom monitoring, high performance cluster and agentless capabilities.

### Features

* Combines **monitoring, alarm, and notification** features into one platform, and supports monitoring for web service, program, database, cache, os, webserver, middleware, bigdata, cloud-native, network, custom and more.
* Easy to use and agentless, offering full web-based operations for monitoring and alerting with just a few clicks, all at zero learning cost.
* Makes protocols such as `Http, Jmx, Ssh, Snmp, Jdbc, Prometheus` configurable, allowing you to collect any metrics by simply configuring the template `YML` file online. Imagine being able to quickly adapt to a new monitoring type like K8s or Docker simply by configuring online with HertzBeat.
* High performance, supports horizontal expansion of multi-collector clusters, multi-isolated network monitoring and cloud-edge collaboration.
* Provides flexible alarm threshold rules and timely notifications delivered via  `Discord` `Slack` `Telegram` `Email` `DingDing` `WeChat` `FeiShu` `Webhook` `SMS`.


> HertzBeat's powerful customization, multi-type support, high performance, easy expansion, and low coupling, aims to help developers and teams quickly build their own monitoring system.      
> We also provide **[SaaS Monitoring Cloud](https://console.tancloud.cn)**, users no longer need to deploy a cumbersome monitoring system to monitor their resources. **[Get started online for free](https://console.tancloud.cn)**.
