## 📫 Preface

> After graduation, I invested a lot of my spare time and did some open source projects [Sureness](https://github.com/dromara/sureness) , [Bootshiro](https://gitee.com/tomsun28/bootshiro) , [Issues-translate-action](https://github.com/usthe/issues-translate-action) ,
> When I had time at work, I answered questions from netizens. When I got home from work, I wrote open source code and helped people solve problems remotely (I also saw it on New Year’s Eve😂), but I always felt that I didn’t have enough time. 
> At that time, I thought it would be great if I could do what I love instead of going to work. Open source feels like a sense of accomplishment as a programmer.        
> Thinking about being young means having to struggle, not to mention it’s something you really want to do. So at the end of 21, I gave up incentives and started open source full-time. It was also the first time to start a full-time business (although there is a high probability of failure, but give it a try and the bicycle will become a motorcycle🤓)       
> I have been working in the APM field for many years. Of course, the direction of starting this business and adding open source is the APM monitoring system of my old bank. We have developed an APM monitoring system that supports multiple monitoring indicators (more monitoring type indicators are being adapted) and has customized monitoring. Supports functions such as threshold alarm notifications, and is a developer-friendly open source monitoring project - Hertz Beat.   
> In order to thank my wife for her full support, the hertzbeat service port defaults to **1157** (unexpectedly) - my wife's name is Yaoyao, and I personally hope that the future baby will be called Wuxia (it is unlikely without the right to speak😂)    
> Thinking that many developers and teams have cloud resources, they may only need to use monitoring services and do not want to deploy complex monitoring systems (often sometimes the monitoring system consumes more server resources than our own services😅), we also provide You can directly log in to use the SAAS cloud monitoring version-[TanCloud](https://console.tancloud.cn).   
> I hope you guys will give me more support and likes, thank you very much.     

## 🎡 <font color="green">Start introducing</font>   

> [HertzBeat](https://github.com/dromara/hertzbeat) It is an open source monitoring and alarm project that supports website, API, PING, port, database and other monitoring types, and has an easy-to-use and friendly visual operation interface.  
> We provide corresponding[SAAS Cloud monitoring version](https://console.tancloud.cn), Small and medium-sized teams and individuals no longer need to deploy a monitoring system to monitor their own website resources, [Sign in to get started for free](https://console.tancloud.cn) surveillance journey.  
> Monitoring demand indicators are often strange. As an open source software for developers, [Custom monitoring](https://hertzbeat.com/docs/advanced/extend-point) It must be arranged. You can customize the monitoring types and indicators you need just by configuring the YML file to meet common personalized needs.   
> HertzBeat Modular, `manager, collector, scheduler, warehouse, alerter` Each module is decoupled, making it easier for everyone to understand, get started and customize development.      
> We also provide more liberal alarm threshold configurations, threshold trigger expressions, three alarm levels, and trigger number configurations. We support alarm notification templates, email webhook and other methods to provide real-time awareness of business status.              
> For more functions, please log in to HertzBeat [Cloud environment TanCloud](https://console.tancloud.cn) Trial discovery.           
> We are iterating rapidly, and you are welcome to participate in co-building the open source ecosystem of the project.    

> `HertzBeat`With multi-type support, easy expansion and low coupling, we hope to help developers and small and medium-sized teams quickly build their own monitoring systems.

- If you want to deploy HertzBeat to an intranet environment to build a monitoring system, please refer to the [deployment document](https://hertzbeat.com/docs/start/quickstart) below.
              
### 🐵 Dependent service deployment

> HertzBeat at least depends on relational database [MYSQL8+](https://www.mysql.com/) and sequential database [TDengine2+](https://www.taosdata.com/getting-started)
                         
##### Install MYSQL
1. Docker install MYSQl  
   `docker run -d --name mysql -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=123456 mysql`
2. Create a database named hertzbeat
3. Execute the database script located in the scriptsql directory of the project warehouse [schema.sql](https://gitee.com/dromara/hertzbeat/raw/master/script/sql/schema.sql)

Detailed step reference [Dependent service MYSQL installation initialization](https://hertzbeat.com/docs/start/mysql-init)

##### Install TDengine
1. Docker install T Dengine   
   `docker run -d -p 6030-6049:6030-6049 -p 6030-6049:6030-6049/udp --name tdengine tdengine/tdengine`
2. Create a database named hertzbeat

Detailed step reference [Dependent service TDengine installation initialization](https://hertzbeat.com/docs/start/tdengine-init)

### 🍞 HertzBeat Install
> HertzBeat supports source code installation and startup, Docker container running and installation package installation and deployment.

##### Quick installation using Docker
`docker run -d -p 1157:1157 --name hertzbeat tancloud/hertzbeat:latest`

Detailed step reference [Install HertzBeat via Docker](https://hertzbeat.com/docs/start/docker-deploy)

##### Install via installation package
