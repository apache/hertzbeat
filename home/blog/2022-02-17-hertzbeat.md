# Open source monitoring and alarm project Hertz Beat is released and enters Dromara incubation  

**Official Website: [hertzbeat.com](https://hertzBeat.com) | [tancloud.cn](https://tancloud.cn)**   
**Warehouse: [https://github.com/dromara/hertzbeat](https://github.com/dromara/hertzbeat) | [https://gitee.com/dromara/hertzbeat](https://gitee.com/dromara/hertzbeat)**  

  Hello everyone, I would like to recommend a monitoring and alarm project that I developed full-time - HertzBeat. Everyone is welcome to learn about it and try it out.


After graduation, I also invested a lot of my spare time and worked on some open source projects [Sureness](https://github.com/dromara/sureness) , [Bootshiro](https://gitee.com/tomsun28/bootshiro) , [Issues-translate-action](https://github.com/usthe/issues-translate-action) ,
At that time, I answered netizensâ€™ questions when I had free time at get off work, wrote open source code when I got home from work, and helped people solve problems remotely (I also watched this on New Yearâ€™s Eve ðŸ˜‚). I always felt that I didnâ€™t have enough time. At that time, I thought that if I didnâ€™t go to work, I could do what I loved. How great. Being able to help others with open source or technology feels like a sense of accomplishment as a programmer.

If you want to do open source, why can't you do it full-time? You have to worry about it when you are young, not to mention it is what you really want to do. So at the end of 21, I gave up incentives and started open source full-time. It was also the first time to start a full-time business (although there is a high probability of failure, but give it a try and the bicycle will become a motorcycleðŸ¤“)

I have been working in the APM field for many years. Of course, the direction of starting this business and adding open source is the monitoring system of my old bank. We have developed a system that supports multiple monitoring indicators (more monitoring type indicators are being adapted), with customized monitoring and support Threshold alarm notification and other functions, a developer-friendly open source monitoring project - HertzBeat.

In order to thank my wife for her full support, the hertzbeat service port defaults to **1157** (unexpectedly) - my wifeâ€™s name is Yaoyao, and I personally hope that the future baby will be named Wu Qie (itâ€™s unlikely without the right to speakðŸ˜‚)

Thinking that many developers and teams have cloud resources, they may only need to use monitoring services and do not want to deploy complex monitoring systems (often sometimes the monitoring system consumes more server resources than our own servicesðŸ˜…), we also provide You can directly log in to the SAAS cloud monitoring version-[TanCloud](https://console.tancloud.cn).   
I hope you guys will support me a lot and like the trial. Thank you very much.
     


### Introducing HertzBeat

> HertzBeat is an open source monitoring and alarm project that supports website, API, PING, port, full site, database and other monitoring types, and has an easy-to-use and friendly visual operation interface.


It is still in the early stages of development and will support more monitoring types later. General software monitoring such as databases, operating systems, cloud native, middleware, application services, etc. are all planned and arranged.

In the field of monitoring, monitoring demand indicators are often strange. As an open source software for developers,[Custom Monitoring](https://hertzbeat.com/docs/advanced/extend-point) must be arranged. You can customize the monitoring types and indicators you need just by configuring the YML file to meet common personalized needs.   
HertzBeat is also modular. Each module of `manager, collector, scheduler, warehouse, alerter` is decoupled, making it easy to understand, get started and customize development.

We also provide more liberal alarm threshold configurations, threshold trigger expressions, three alarm levels, and trigger number configurations. We support alarm notification templates, email webhooks and other methods of alarm notification to sense business status in real time.
For more functions, please log in to HertzBeatâ€™s [Cloud Environment TanCloud](https://console.tancloud.cn) https://console.tancloud.cn for trial discovery.

The project is being rapidly iterated, and you are welcome to join us to build an open source ecosystem for the project.

**About HertzBeatâ€™s cloud SAAS environment TanCloud - https://console.tancloud.cn**        

Many of our developers will have their own servers, blog sites, databases, cloud services and other cloud resources. For us developers or small and medium-sized teams, I think it is worth exploring how to spend the minimum effort to monitor our cloud resources. If they are down or abnormal, we can be notified in time for processing.

If we deploy a monitoring system ourselves and use it on the server, regardless of the learning cost and time cost, sometimes the monitoring system consumes more server resources than our own website, which makes the originally tight server resources Even more nervous.

In this regard, we provide a SAAS cloud monitoring service. Our developers or small and medium-sized teams no longer need to deploy a cumbersome monitoring system in order to monitor their own websites and other cloud resources.

[Sign in to get started for free](https://console.tancloud.cn) https://console.tancloud.cn. At present, the cloud environment functions are still being rapidly iterated, and tenants, permissions and other functions will be arranged. Welcome to try it out and provide comments.




Veterans can intuitively understand the functions through the demonstration video: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Vi4y1f7i8
