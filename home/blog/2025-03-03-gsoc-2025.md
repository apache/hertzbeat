## The Origin and Purpose of GSOC

GSOC, namely Google Summer of Code, is a global initiative launched by Google. It aims to encourage students to participate in the development of open-source software projects. Here is a detailed introduction:

- GSOC started in 2005. Initially, it was a project established by Google to promote the development of the open-source community and encourage more students to engage in the development and innovation of open-source software. Through this project, Google hopes to inject fresh blood into the open-source world, enabling students to enhance their technical capabilities through practice, and at the same time, bring new ideas and contributions to open-source projects.

## Task: An AI Agent for Monitoring Information Interaction Based on the MCP Protocol

**Website**: `https://hertzbeat.apache.org/`

**Github**: `http://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/`

### Background

Apache HertzBeat is an open-source real-time monitoring tool that supports a wide range of monitoring targets, including web services, databases, middleware, and more. It is characterized by high performance, scalability, and security.

With the continuous advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, integrating AI with monitoring systems can significantly improve their usability and interactivity. By developing an AI agent based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), we aim to enable conversational interaction for querying monitoring information, adding new monitoring tasks, and retrieving monitoring metrics. This will provide a more user-friendly and intelligent monitoring management experience.

## Functional Requirements

### Query Monitoring and Alarm Information

1. **Monitoring Item Status Monitoring**
   Be able to obtain the status of monitoring items through natural language;
   For example: Which monitoring items are currently abnormal? It should inform the user which monitoring items are abnormal and the time when the abnormality occurred.

2. **Search for Metric Data**
   Be able to obtain metric data through natural language;
   For example: a. Which servers currently have a CPU usage rate exceeding 80%?
   b. Display the CPU usage of server 192.168.1.1 in the last day in the form of a chart.

3. **Alarm Data**
   Obtain alarm data through natural language;
   For example: Which monitoring alarms have been more frequent recently?

### Add New Monitoring Tasks

1. **Add New Monitoring Targets**
   Be able to add new monitoring targets through natural language;
   For example: a. I want to monitor the response time of the web service.
   b. Please help me add monitoring for the database connection pool.
2. **Configure Alarm Thresholds**
   Be able to configure alarm thresholds through natural language;
   For example: a. Trigger an alarm when the web service response time exceeds 5 seconds.
   b. Send a notification when the database connection pool usage rate exceeds 90%.

### Considerations During Design

1. There are many data sources supported by the underlying storage. How to monitor? For example: Natural language -> SQL -> Query data source -> Large language model.
2. Compatibility with large language models, supporting commonly used models.
3. The usability of the solution, making it convenient for users to use.

### Requirement Analysis

- **Apache HertzBeat**: As the core backend of the monitoring system, it provides data collection, storage, and management functions.
- **MCP Protocol**: An open protocol that enables seamless integration between large language model (LLM) applications and external data sources and tools.
- **Front-end Interaction**: Develop a user-friendly interface that supports voice or text input and displays monitoring information and interaction results.

### Recommended Skills

- **Java + TypeScript**: Apache HertzBeat is developed based on this technology stack. Therefore, mastering these technologies is crucial for integrating with HertzBeat.
- **SpringAi**: It is recommended to use SpringAi to build the AI agent.
- **LLM + MCP**: You need to understand large language models (LLM) and the MCP protocol. SpringAi seems to support the MCP protocol, or you can consider using the mcp-sdk directly.

### Scale

- **Difficulty**: Difficult
- **Project Scale**: Approximately 350 hours

### Mentors

If you are interested, you can send an email to the mentors, including your solution and ideas.

- **Gong Chao**: `gongchao@apache.org`
- **Zhang Shenghang**: `shenghang@apache.org`

## How Can I Increase My Chances of Being Selected as a GSoC Contributor?

1. After the list of organizations is announced, please visit the program website to view these organizations and find several organizations that interest you.
2. Carefully read the "Project Ideas" list of these organizations.
3. If you see an idea that interests you, please contact the organization through the organization's preferred communication method (listed on the organization's page on the GSoC website).
4. Communicate with the mentors and community members to determine whether this project idea is something you are willing to implement during the program. If what you do is not something you are interested in, it will not be a pleasant summer vacation for you and your mentor.
5. During the communication with the mentors and other members of the organization's community, you have obtained some information. Use this information to write a proposal.
6. Please submit the proposal as early as possible so that the mentors have time to provide feedback. You need to have time to make revisions based on their feedback and resubmit it before the deadline. Do not wait until the last minute to submit the proposal!
