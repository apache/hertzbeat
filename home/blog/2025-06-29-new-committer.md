> Hello everyone, it's a great honor to be invited by the community to become Apache HertzBeat Committer.

## Self-Introduction

I've been working in development since 2019, engaging in various fields such as blockchain, cybersecurity, big data, new energy, and video technology. I'm a jack-of-all-trades engineer who dabbles in a bit of everything.

## My Journey with HertzBeat

Initially, while setting up several services for myself, I needed a way to visualize metrics but didn't want to introduce overly complex monitoring systems. I hoped to find an out-of-the-box monitoring tool that was comprehensive and easy to extend – that’s when I discovered HertzBeat.

As I used it more deeply, I began exploring its source code and developed a desire to contribute to the community. I still vividly remember the anticipation during my first pull request (PR), going through multiple rounds of debugging and verification, eagerly hoping it would be accepted into the main branch. With increased involvement, tracking community updates has gradually become a daily habit.

## Welcoming Community Atmosphere

The community thrives with activity, as code submissions and reviews pour in even during late-night hours. It embraces newcomers with open arms, ensuring that whether you're filing an ISSUE to report a bug or submitting a PR to contribute code, your efforts will spark thoughtful discussions and elicit detailed, actionable feedback.

Currently, HertzBeat is in a phase of rapid development, with capabilities such as metrics, logs, and tracing requiring continuous enhancement and refinement. If you're interested in contributing to open-source, this is an excellent opportunity to get involved.

## About Open Source

For me, open source is a vessel for technical passion; growing alongside the community makes for a profoundly meaningful journey.

## Conclusion

A heartfelt thank you to [@tomsun28](https://github.com/tomsun28) for the nomination and guidance. I hope this encouragement drives me to make even more valuable contributions to the community. Finally, wishing Apache HertzBeat a smooth graduation from the Apache Incubator and may the community continue to grow and thrive!
