> HertzBeat supports more liberal threshold alarm configuration (calculation expression), supports alarm notification, alarm template, email, DingDing, WeChat FeiShu and WebHook.    
> Most important is HertzBeat supports [Custom Monitoring](https://hertzbeat.com/docs/advanced/extend-point), just by configuring the YML file, we can customize the monitoring types and metrics what we need.      
> HertzBeat is modular, `manager, collector, scheduler, warehouse, alerter` modules are decoupled for easy understanding and custom development.  
> Welcome to HertzBeat's [Cloud Environment TanCloud](https://console.tancloud.cn) to try and discover more.    
> Welcome to join us to build hertzbeat together.

> `HertzBeat`'s multi-type support, easy expansion, low coupling, hope to help developers and micro teams to quickly build their own monitoring tool.
