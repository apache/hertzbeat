## Use HertzBeat to monitor the Internet of Things database IoTDB, and it will be done in 5 minutes!

### Introduction to IoTDB

> Apache IoTDB (Internet of Things Database) is a time-series database management system that can provide users with data collection, storage and analysis services.
> Due to its lightweight architecture, high performance and high availability, and seamless integration with Hadoop and Spark ecosystems, IoTDB meets the requirements of massive data storage, high-throughput data writing, and complex data query and analysis in the industrial IoT field. need.

### Introduction to HertzBeat

> HertzBeat is an open source, easy-to-use and friendly real-time monitoring tool that does not require Agent and has powerful custom monitoring capabilities.
> Supports monitoring of application services, databases, operating systems, middleware, cloud native, etc., threshold alarms, and alarm notifications (email WeChat Dingding Feishu).
> HertzBeat's powerful customization, multi-type support, easy expansion, and low coupling hope to help developers and small and medium teams quickly build their own monitoring tools.

### Get monitoring IoTDB in HertzBeat in 5 minutes

#### Prerequisites, you already have IoTDB environment and HertzBeat environment.

- IoTDB [deployment and installation documentation](https://iotdb.apache.org/UserGuide/V0.13.x/QuickStart/QuickStart.html)
- HertzBeat [deployment installation documentation](https://hertzbeat.com/docs/start/docker-deploy)

#### 1. Enable the `metrics` function on the IoTDB side, which will provide interface data in the form of prometheus metrics.

1. The metric collection is disabled by default, you need to modify the parameters in `conf/iotdb-metric.yml` first, then restart the server
```
# Whether to start the monitoring module, the default is false
enableMetric: true

# Data provision method, externally provide metrics data through jmx and prometheus protocol, optional parameters: [JMX, PROMETHEUS, IOTDB], IOTDB is closed by default.
metricReporterList:
   - JMX
   - PROMETHEUS
```

2. Restart IoTDB, open a browser or use curl to access http://ip:9091/metrics, and you can see the metric data.

#### 2. Add IoTDB monitoring on the HertzBeat monitoring page

1. Click Add IoTDB Monitoring

Path: Menu -> Database Monitoring -> IoTDB Monitoring -> Add IoTDB Monitoring

2. Configure the parameters required for monitoring IoTDB

Fill in the IoTDB **service IP** and **monitoring port** (default 9091) on the monitoring page, and finally click OK to add.
For other parameters such as **collection interval**, **timeout period**, etc., please refer to [Help Documentation](https://hertzbeat.com/docs/help/iotdb/) https://hertzbeat.com/docs/help /iotdb/

3. Complete ‚úÖ, now we have added the monitoring of IoTDB, check the monitoring list to see our added items.

![hertzbeat](/img/blog/monitor-iotdb-3.png)

4. Click **Operation**->**Monitoring Details Icon** of the monitoring list item to browse the real-time monitoring metric data of IoTDB.

5. Click **Monitoring History Details TAB** to browse IoTDB's historical monitoring metric data chartüìà.

**Complete DONE! Through the above steps, it is actually two steps to sum up**
- **Enable `metrics` function on IoTDB in one step**
- **Another step is to configure the IP port on the HertzBeat monitoring page to add monitoring**


**In this way, we have completed the monitoring of IoTDB. We can view the monitoring details and metrics at any time to observe its service status, but people cannot always watch it. When there is always a time to rest, monitoring is often accompanied by alarms. When monitoring When the metrics are abnormal, the monitoring tool needs to be able to notify the person in charge in time**

**Next, we will teach you step by step to configure the threshold alarm notification in the HertzBeat system**

#### 3. Add IoTDB metric threshold alarm in HertzBeat system

1. Configure a threshold alarm for an important metric

Path: Menu -> Alarm Threshold -> Add Threshold

- Select the configured metric object. IotDB monitors many metrics, one of which is related to the status of the node `cluster_node_status` -> `status` (node status, 1=online 2=offline).
- Here we configure to send an alarm when the metric `status==2`, the alarm level is **Critical Alarm**, which is triggered once, as shown in the figure below.

2. Add message notification recipients

Path: Menu -> Alarm Notification -> Alarm Recipient -> Add New Recipient

Message notification methods support **email, DingTalk, WeChat Work, Feishu, WebHook, SMS**, etc. Here we take the commonly used DingTalk as an example.

- Refer to this [Help Documentation](https://hertzbeat.com/docs/help/alert_dingtalk) https://hertzbeat.com/docs/help/alert_dingtalk to configure the robot on DingTalk and set the security custom keyword `HertzBeat `, get the corresponding `access_token` value.
- Configure the receiver parameters in HertzBeat as follows.

„ÄêAlarm Notification„Äë->„ÄêNew Recipient„Äë->„ÄêSelect DingTalk Robot Notification Method„Äë->„ÄêSet DingTalk Robot ACCESS_TOKEN„Äë->„ÄêOK„Äë

3. Configure the associated alarm notification strategy ‚ö†Ô∏è [Add notification strategy] -> [Associate the recipient just set] -> [OK]

### Finished, now wait for the warning message to come. ding ding ding ding

```
[HertzBeat warning notification]
Alarm target object: iotdb.cluster_node_status.status
Affiliated monitoring ID: 205540620349696
Belonging monitoring name: IOTDB_localhost
Alarm level: critical alarm
Alarm trigger time: 2023-01-05 22:17:06
Content details: The status of IOTDB node 127.0.0.1 is monitored as OFFLINE, please deal with it in time.
```

## Summary

This practical article took us to experience that if HertzBeat is used to monitor the IoTDB database metric data, we can find that HertzBeat, which integrates monitoring-alarm-notification, is more convenient in operation and use, and IoTDB can be included in the monitoring with a simple click on the page, it is no longer necessary to deploy multiple components and write multiple YML configuration files with thresholds.
