Hello everyone, HertzBeat v1.1.0 is here! In this version, we've added support for the SNMP protocol and enabled application monitoring for Windows operating systems using SNMP.  
Another major change is that we've switched from using MYSQL to H2 database by default for storage, making it easier for users to install and deploy. Now, you can get started with HertzBeat using just a single docker command: `docker run -d -p 1157:1157 --name hertzbeat apache/hertzbeat`
Let's Try It!
