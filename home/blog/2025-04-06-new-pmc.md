## From Committer to PMC: The Transformation and Growth of Roles

A year ago, when I received the notification of becoming an Apache HertzBeat **Committer**, the joy and sense of mission I felt are still vivid in my memory. At that time, I was more focused on specific technical implementations and feature developments. Now, being invited to join the **PMC** means that I need to view the project's development from a more comprehensive perspective. This is not only an acknowledgment of my participation in open source but also a call for future responsibilities.

### In-depth Participation: Accumulation during the Committer Period

After becoming a Committer, my daily work changed significantly:

- **Code review became the norm**: From the initial simple PR reviews to the ability to systematically evaluate code quality, the rationality of the architecture, and consistency with the overall project direction.
- **Tighter community collaboration**: I started to regularly participate in community meetings, assist new contributors in solving problems, and even take the lead in the development and implementation of certain features.
- **Participation in technical decision-making**: On key issues such as monitoring protocol support and storage engine optimization, I began to put forward my own opinions and jointly develop implementation plans with the core team.

During this period, I deeply realized that **the vitality of an open source project lies not only in the code but also in community collaboration and trust**. Every code merge and every problem discussion are minor adjustments to the project's direction, and the role of the Committer gave me the opportunity to be involved.

## Becoming a PMC: The Upgrade of Responsibilities and Challenges

The responsibilities of the PMC go far beyond the code level. It requires members to have a deeper understanding and thinking about the project's **technical direction, community governance, and long-term development**. When I received the PMC invitation, I felt excited but also realized that I needed to face new challenges:

### 1. Participation in Technical Strategy

As a PMC, I need to jointly plan the long-term roadmap of HertzBeat with other members. For example:

- **Performance optimization**: In the face of large-scale monitoring scenarios, how to optimize storage and query efficiency.
- **Enhanced scalability**: How to design a more flexible plugin mechanism to facilitate the community to contribute new monitoring types.

These issues are no longer simple code implementations but involve in-depth discussions on technical selection, community resource allocation, and even project positioning.

### 2. Community Governance and Health

The PMC needs to pay attention to the long-term healthy development of the community, including:

- **Contributor experience**: How to optimize the documentation and lower the entry threshold for new members.
- **Community culture**: Ensure a friendly discussion atmosphere and that conflicts can be properly resolved.
- **Sustainable development**: Motivate long-term contributors while attracting new blood.

## Personal Growth: The Transformation of Skills and Mentality

This year's experience has improved me in multiple dimensions:

- **Technical breadth**: From focusing on specific functions to understanding the overall architecture of the distributed monitoring system.
- **Soft skills**: Learned how to communicate effectively, coordinate different opinions, and promote community consensus.
- **Project management**: Understood the operation mode of open source projects and balanced the ideal and practical constraints.

The most profound realization is that **in the open source community, technical ability is just the foundation, and the real value lies in whether you can create achievements greater than the individual through collaboration**.

## Future Prospects: Moving Forward with HertzBeat

As a newly appointed PMC, I have several key directions for the future:

1. **Promote HertzBeat to become an important choice in the field of cloud-native monitoring**, especially to form a differentiated advantage in terms of lightweight and ease of use.
2. **Build a more active contributor community** and cultivate core contributors through mentorship programs, regular activities, and other means.
3. **Improve the project governance process** to make decision-making more transparent and participation smoother.

## Acknowledgments and Encouragement

I would like to especially thank **Tom** for his guidance and all community partners for their support. The Apache Way emphasizes that "community is more important than code", and this concept has deeply influenced my way of working.

Finally, I want to share with you who are reading this: **Open source is a long-lasting and warm journey. There is no need to pursue quick success. Just keep contributing, and the rewards will come naturally**. I look forward to meeting more like-minded friends in the HertzBeat community!

As we often say: **"Participating in open source is to make technology better, not to make life busier"** â€”â€” Let's encourage each other ðŸ˜Š
