> Hello everyone, it's a great honor to be invited by the community to become a Committer of the Apache HertzBeat project.

## Self-Introduction

I have been engaged in Java backend development since 2022. Currently, I am working as a backend developer in a company and also taking on some operations and maintenance tasks.

## Getting to know Apache HertzBeat

Last year, I came across the Apache HertzBeat project by chance. After reading the documentation, I found that this monitoring tool is easy to use, does not require an Agent, and can be operated entirely through a web page. So, I quickly set it up within the company based on Docker and put it into use.

Due to the `All in one` design architecture of Apache HertzBeat, it has greatly reduced my mental burden, and I was able to quickly integrate various internal company services into the monitoring system.

## Participate and Contribute

During the usage process, I discovered a database query bug. So, I forked the code and started debugging it locally. I found that the fix was not complicated and since no one else had addressed it, I submitted my first PR. To my surprise, it was merged quickly, which greatly encouraged me.

In the following period, I continued to familiarize myself with the Apache HertzBeat code, paying close attention to ISSUES and PRs. As my understanding of the system deepened, apart from fixing BUGs and improving documentation, I also developed some new features, such as database storage templates and SSH tunnels.

## Conclusion

I'm deeply grateful to [@tomsun28](https://github.com/tomsun28) for inviting me to become a committer for this project. I also want to thank other members of the community for assisting me in reviewing code and providing invaluable help. Apache Hertzbeat boasts a highly active community, and I sincerely hope more people will join and contribute to it, Finally, I wish Apache HertzBeat can graduate from the incubator soon!
