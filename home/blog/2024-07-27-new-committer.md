> It's an honor for me to become a Committer of Apache Hertzbeat

## Personal introduction

I have been working as a Java back-end developer for three years. At present, I participate in the development of converged message center in an Internet company. 

## First met Apache Hertzbeat

Reading code and design in open-source framework is one way for me to improve myself. One day a thought came to my mind, which is to contribute to open-source community. Then I met Hertzbeat in an article on the internel, which is completely different from Prometheus and Skywalking that I had known before. Hertzbeat fascinate me with its feature, agentless and anyone can custom monitoring by monifying yaml. I forked Hertzbeat on GitHub and tried to run it locally for further study.

## My first PR

I failed to start Hertzbeat when I followed instructions in CONTRIBUTING. The exception shows that Node.js version at lease 18 is required. Therefor I modified CONTRIBUTING and opened my first PR in Hertzbeat community. 

## Keep active in community

I'm getting familiar with Hertzbeat as I read documents and code. In addition to perfecting documentation and fixing bugs, I completed DNS monitoring and Registry monitoring. After that, I started to develop new feature named http_sd in V1.6.1, which is supported to manage monitor automatically.

## Reward

At the beginning, it was only the simplest revision and translation of documents. Although it was a very simple job, the community was really welcoming, which made me deeply feel the inclusiveness of this community. Later, while developing the new feature http_sd, my conversation with author tom gave me a better understanding of the overall architecture and responsibilities of each module of Hertzbeat, which led to the completion of the new feature.

During the reading of Hertzbeat source code, I learned a lot of code writing and design, which is helpful for my personal growth.

## Conclusion

It's an interesting experience for me to become a Committer of Apache Hertzbeat and it motivates me day by day. I will continue to contribute to the Apache Hertzbeat community in the future, and I hope that Apache Hertzbeat can successfully graduate from the Apache incubator.
