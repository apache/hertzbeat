## Self-Introduction

Hello everyone, I am deeply honored to be invited as a Committer for Apache HertzBeat.

I have been in the software development industry for many years, currently working as a backend development engineer in my company, mainly responsible for the development and maintenance of core business systems. In my daily work, I not only focus on code quality and system performance but also actively participate in the design and optimization of technical solutions.

Besides work, I am also passionate about the open-source community. Participating in open-source projects not only allows me to continuously learn new technologies and best practices but also helps me meet like-minded developers and jointly promote technological advancement. Becoming a Committer for Apache HertzBeat is an important milestone in my open-source journey, and I will continue to strive to make more contributions to the project and community.

## Participating in the Apache Community

The first Apache project I participated in was Apache ShenYu (<https://github.com/apache/shenyu>). As an API gateway project, ShenYu provided me with an opportunity to gain a deep understanding of microservice architecture and gateway technology. Through my involvement in ShenYu's development, I not only enhanced my technical skills but also learned about the collaboration methods and open-source spirit of the Apache community.

This experience gave me a deeper understanding of the Apache community and laid the foundation for my later participation in other Apache projects, such as HertzBeat. From ShenYu to HertzBeat, I gradually deepened my understanding and contribution to Apache projects, eventually becoming a Committer for HertzBeat.

## Encountering HertzBeat and Starting to Contribute

After participating in the Apache ShenYu project, I gained a deeper understanding of how open-source communities operate. At this time, I came across the Apache HertzBeat project by chance, which aims to create an easy-to-use, high-performance open-source real-time monitoring and alerting system.

HertzBeat's philosophy and functionality immediately caught my interest. As a backend development engineer, I deeply understand the importance of monitoring systems in modern software architecture. HertzBeat not only provides rich monitoring features but also focuses on user experience and scalability, which aligns very well with my technical philosophy.

With enthusiasm for the project, I began to delve into HertzBeat's codebase and documentation. I found many interesting challenges and areas for improvement in the project, which sparked my desire to contribute. After gradually familiarizing myself with the project structure and contribution process, I contributed my accumulated experience in monitoring various relational databases, NoSQL, and other middleware from my work to the project.

As my understanding of the project deepened, I began to try solving more complex problems, such as performance optimization and new feature development. Each contribution not only taught me new knowledge but also made me feel the power and warmth of the open-source community. The feedback and support from project maintainers and other contributors further convinced me that participating in HertzBeat was the right choice.

Through continuous contributions and interactions with community members, I gradually became an active member of the HertzBeat community. This experience not only improved my technical skills but also gave me a deep understanding of the open-source spirit and the importance of collaboration. It was these ongoing contributions and participation that ultimately led to my nomination as a Committer for HertzBeat.

## Conclusion

Becoming a Committer for Apache HertzBeat is an important milestone in my open-source journey. I will continue to strive to make more contributions to the project and community, while also looking forward to growing and progressing together with more team members, jointly promoting the prosperity and development of the project.
