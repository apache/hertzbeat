Hello everyone, I'm Yang Chen, currently a graduate student at Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications. I'm deeply honored to receive recognition and invitation from the Apache HertzBeat community to officially become a project Committer. This marks the true beginning of my open-source journey!

## My Open Source Exploration

As early as my undergraduate years, I had exposure to open source.
Back then, I developed a [epidemic notice QQ bot](https://github.com/bigcyy/GroupNotifier) based on the open-source [Mirai](https://github.com/mamoe/mirai) framework. However, that was more at the usage level.
In my junior year, I attempted to independently open-source an AI project called [customized_chat](https://github.com/bigcyy/customized-chat), which was my first step into "open source."
But these experiences were all solo explorations, and I deeply felt that this wasn't true open source, as it failed to establish a complete community ecosystem.

## Meeting HertzBeat: True Open Source Practice

To participate more deeply in open source, I began searching for suitable open-source activities and thus encountered HertzBeat. For me, this was the true beginning of my open-source journey. Here, I not only learned solid technical development but also experienced a mature community ecosystem. I deeply understood the essence of the "Apache Way" - the community builds the project, not the project builds the community.

I first learned about HertzBeat through GSoC (Google Summer of Code), when the community's proposal about developing monitoring MCP deeply attracted me. So I proactively contacted Tom and officially began participating in community activities. Tom was very enthusiastic, and the entire community was exceptionally active.
I clearly remember my first PR (Pull Request), when I even conducted online testing with a user in an Issue, which was quite a unique experience for me. Although I wasn't ultimately selected for GSoC, during that period, I had already deeply participated in the community and fully experienced its excellence.

## Growth and Gains from Open Source

Participating in open source has indeed significantly improved my abilities. By reading HertzBeat's architectural design and actively participating in community discussions, I've accumulated many valuable experiences, such as:

- Cutting-edge Technology: I gained deep understanding of monitoring system design and implementation, and practiced core technologies like concurrent programming and distributed systems in the project.
- Practical Abilities: Through solving real problems and participating in code contributions, I successfully transformed theoretical knowledge into practical operational skills.
- Community Culture Experience: I personally experienced the unique charm of the "Apache Way" and engaged in deep exchanges and learning with developers from around the world.

My experience has convinced me that open source is not just about writing code, but an excellent platform for learning, growing, and contributing.

If you're also passionate about technology, eager to improve yourself through practice, and want to experience true community collaboration, then the Apache HertzBeat community is definitely your best choice!

## Finally

I sincerely thank [Tom](https://github.com/tomsun28), [Shenghang](https://github.com/zhangshenghang), [Logic](https://github.com/zqr10159), and other community members for their meticulous code reviews and patient guidance. I hope Apache HertzBeat continues to thrive!
