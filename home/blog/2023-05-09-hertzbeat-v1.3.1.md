### What is HertzBeat?

> [HertzBeat](https://github.com/dromara/hertzbeat) is an open source, real-time monitoring system with custom-monitoring and agentLess.
> **Monitoring+Alarm+Notify** all in one. Support monitoring web service, database, os, middleware, cloud-native, network and more.      
> Easy to use, full web-based operation, monitoring and alerting at the click of a mouse, zero learning cost.     
> More flexible threshold rule, timely notification delivery by `Discord` `Slack` `Telegram` `Email` `DingDing` `WeChat` `FeiShu` `Webhook` `SMS`.

> We make protocols such as `Http, Jmx, Ssh, Snmp, Jdbc` configurable, and you only need to configure `YML` online to collect any metrics you want.     
> Do you believe that you can immediately adapt a new monitoring type such as K8s or Docker just by configuring online?

> `HertzBeat`'s powerful custom-define, multi-type support, easy expansion, low coupling, hope to help developers and micro teams to quickly build their own monitoring system.     
> We also provide **[Monitoring SaaS Cloud](https://console.tancloud.cn)**, users no longer need to deploy a cumbersome monitoring system in order to monitor resources. **[Get started for free](https://console.tancloud.cn)**.
