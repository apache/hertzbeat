<p>Hello everyone, it's a great honor to be invited by the community to become Apache HertzBeat Committer.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_oTFZ" id="self-introduction">Self-Introduction<a href="https://hertzbeat.apache.org/blog/2025/12/07/new-committer#self-introduction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Since starting my career, I have mainly been engaged in backend development work and have a great interest in open-source projects. I am currently employed at a financial software company and also undertake the management work of operation and maintenance.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_oTFZ" id="first-encounter-apache-hertzbeat">First Encounter Apache HertzBeat<a href="https://hertzbeat.apache.org/blog/2025/12/07/new-committer#first-encounter-apache-hertzbeat" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>In our actual work, we have been using the monitoring system consisting of Prometheus and Grafana. As the number of devices and services to be monitored increased, and due to the limited number of operation and maintenance personnel, the workload for daily configuration and maintenance rose sharply, making it impossible for us to promptly handle and respond to user feedback.
At this point, we have been constantly looking for a lightweight open-source monitoring system. Apache HertzBeat is ready to use out of the box, has comprehensive functions, does not require an agent, is compatible with Prometheus, and fully covers all the protocols we currently use. Therefore, we quickly set it up and put it into use based on Docker internally.</p>
<p>As an open-source enthusiast myself, I encountered a few minor issues after using the software for some time. Since it happened to be written in a programming language I'm proficient in, I delved into the source code, endeavoured to refine the implementation, and contributed my improvements back to the community.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_oTFZ" id="the-path-to-open-source-contributions">The Path to Open Source Contributions<a href="https://hertzbeat.apache.org/blog/2025/12/07/new-committer#the-path-to-open-source-contributions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>I initially began using the tagging feature, only to discover right away that tag maintenance had an NPE issue. So I delved into the source code and gained a preliminary understanding of the cause. Following the official documentation, I submitted <a href="https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/issues/3605" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">issue#3605</a> and created my first pull request to address it. Though a minor change, it was merged promptly, which proved immensely encouraging.</p>
<p>During subsequent, more in-depth usage, based on the actual monitored devices and scenarios, I primarily added several new monitoring services, such as <a href="https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/pull/3656" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Apache DolphinScheduler</a>, <a href="https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/pull/3715" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">MacOS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/pull/3721" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Synology NAS</a>, amongst others. Collaborating with other community contributors, I refined and resolved the <code>jexl</code> keyword issue while also enhancing the status page functionality.</p>

<p>Through daily contributions to Apache HertzBeat, I have also learnt how to collaborate more effectively within open-source projects. Communicating and working alongside community members has given me a deeper appreciation for the unique appeal of the ‘Apache Way’ and the spirit of open-source.</p>
<p>Becoming a Committer entails greater responsibility. Beyond continuing to contribute, it is vital to maintain a rigorous approach, offering constructive feedback and recognition to contributors, thereby helping more individuals participate in the community and grow within it.</p>

<p>For developers who are new to open source, first of all, please be brave to try and let go of your worries to take the first step. The process of making contributions requires time, but as long as you have patience, you will achieve results.</p>
<p>In the Apache HertzBeat community, by communicating more, many enthusiastic and friendly open-source contributors in the community can collaborate together. We can first gradually use and experience the functions, and start to attempt to contribute. For example, small contributions such as correcting spelling errors in the documentation and fixing incorrect comments, and then gradually deepen our understanding of the source code and try to fix the problems.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_oTFZ" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://hertzbeat.apache.org/blog/2025/12/07/new-committer#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>My heartfelt thanks to all community partners for your patient reviews and thoughtful guidance. It has been a tremendous privilege to witness Apache HertzBeat successfully graduate to a TLP project during this period.</p>
<p>Becoming a Committer marks merely a small milestone for me. I look forward to continuing to uphold the spirit of open source alongside Apache HertzBeat, attracting more outstanding developers to jointly build a technologically advanced and vibrant community.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In practical projects, to enhance the existing monitoring system, we aim to implement visual monitoring and alerts for existing metrics. However, we also wish to avoid introducing or integrating overly complex monitoring systems. Consequently, I began searching for a monitoring solution that is ready-to-use, feature-rich, and easily extensible. It was during this process that I gradually encountered and became familiar with Apache HertzBeat.</p>
<p>Through continuous research and debugging, I began delving into its source code and gradually became involved in community contributions. Today, keeping up with community updates, reviewing pull requests, and discussing issues have become part of my daily routine.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_oTFZ" id="the-path-to-open-source-contributions">The Path to Open Source Contributions<a href="https://hertzbeat.apache.org/blog/2025/10/31/new-committer#the-path-to-open-source-contributions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The initial biggest challenge in formally contributing to the Apache HertzBeat project was unfamiliarity with its architecture, particularly the collaboration mechanisms between modules. By reading official documentation, source code, and historical PRs from the community, I gradually gained clarity on the project's structure. Simultaneously, discussions with community members during PR reviews provided invaluable advice and fresh perspectives—these exchanges fostered significant growth.</p>
<p>Through systematic reading of source code and analysis of historical changes, I gradually gained a deep understanding of the project structure and actively participated in code fixes and feature enhancements. To date, I have submitted and merged multiple contributions to the Apache HertzBeat project, including but not limited to:</p>

<p>In 2023, I stumbled upon the open-source project HertzBeat. At the time, I was still just following online tutorials and books to learn the source code of some well-known open-source frameworks.
With a mindset of learning, I attempted to run HertzBeat locally. However, I soon encountered an issue where the project wouldn't start. Because of this, I submitted my first PR—modifying the startup documentation.
This PR was swiftly merged into the master branch, which greatly encouraged me. From then on, I began to delve deeper into HertzBeat. It was challenging at first, and I didn't know where to start.
As I gained a deeper understanding of it, I gradually began to dissect its modules and code structure. During this period, I claimed numerous tasks and bugs from the community's issue list and submitted corresponding PRs.
From documentation, unit testing, frontend, backend, to new feature development, I unknowingly gained extensive knowledge within this project. This knowledge no longer felt cold and abstract like what's presented in books or blogs; instead, it came alive before my eyes.</p>
<p>A year later, I became a Committer—a new phase in my contributions to open-source projects. Beyond maintaining code, this role emphasizes proactively fostering a positive community atmosphere and mentoring new contributors to deepen their involvement with HertzBeat. This experience revealed that technology isn't just about code—it's about collaboration, sharing, and collective growth.</p>
<p>Today, I am honored to be invited to join the PMC. This recognition not only affirms my past contributions but also fuels my motivation to continue nurturing the community's growth! I sincerely wish Apache HertzBeat a healthy and enduring future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone, I'm Yang Chen, currently a graduate student at Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications. I'm deeply honored to receive recognition and invitation from the Apache HertzBeat™ community to officially become a project Committer. This marks the true beginning of my open-source journey!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_oTFZ" id="my-open-source-exploration">My Open Source Exploration<a href="https://hertzbeat.apache.org/blog/2025/07/11/new-committer#my-open-source-exploration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>As early as my undergraduate years, I had exposure to open source.
Back then, I developed a <a href="https://github.com/bigcyy/GroupNotifier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">epidemic notice QQ bot</a> based on the open-source <a href="https://github.com/mamoe/mirai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Mirai</a> framework. However, that was more at the usage level.
In my junior year, I attempted to independently open-source an AI project called <a href="https://github.com/bigcyy/customized-chat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">customized_chat</a>, which was my first step into "open source."
But these experiences were all solo explorations, and I deeply felt that this wasn't true open source, as it failed to establish a complete community ecosystem.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_oTFZ" id="meeting-hertzbeat-true-open-source-practice">Meeting HertzBeat: True Open Source Practice<a href="https://hertzbeat.apache.org/blog/2025/07/11/new-committer#meeting-hertzbeat-true-open-source-practice" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>To participate more deeply in open source, I began searching for suitable open-source activities and thus encountered HertzBeat. For me, this was the true beginning of my open-source journey. Here, I not only learned solid technical development but also experienced a mature community ecosystem. I deeply understood the essence of the "Apache Way" - the community builds the project, not the project builds the community.</p>
<p>I first learned about HertzBeat through GSoC (Google Summer of Code), when the community's proposal about developing monitoring MCP deeply attracted me. So I proactively contacted Tom and officially began participating in community activities. Tom was very enthusiastic, and the entire community was exceptionally active.
I clearly remember my first PR (Pull Request), when I even conducted online testing with a user in an Issue, which was quite a unique experience for me. Although I wasn't ultimately selected for GSoC, during that period, I had already deeply participated in the community and fully experienced its excellence.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_oTFZ" id="growth-and-gains-from-open-source">Growth and Gains from Open Source<a href="https://hertzbeat.apache.org/blog/2025/07/11/new-committer#growth-and-gains-from-open-source" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Participating in open source has indeed significantly improved my abilities. By reading HertzBeat's architectural design and actively participating in community discussions, I've accumulated many valuable experiences, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Cutting-edge Technology: I gained deep understanding of monitoring system design and implementation, and practiced core technologies like concurrent programming and distributed systems in the project.</li>
<li class="">Practical Abilities: Through solving real problems and participating in code contributions, I successfully transformed theoretical knowledge into practical operational skills.</li>
<li class="">Community Culture Experience: I personally experienced the unique charm of the "Apache Way" and engaged in deep exchanges and learning with developers from around the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>My experience has convinced me that open source is not just about writing code, but an excellent platform for learning, growing, and contributing.</p>
<p>If you're also passionate about technology, eager to improve yourself through practice, and want to experience true community collaboration, then the Apache HertzBeat™ community is definitely your best choice!</p>

<p>I sincerely thank <a href="https://github.com/tomsun28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Tom</a>, <a href="https://github.com/zhangshenghang" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Shenghang</a>, <a href="https://github.com/zqr10159" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">Logic</a>, and other community members for their meticulous code reviews and patient guidance.

<p>Hello everyone, it's a great honor to be invited by the community to become Apache HertzBeat™ Committer.</p>

<p>I've been working in development since 2019, engaging in various fields such as blockchain, cybersecurity, big data, new energy, and video technology. I'm a jack-of-all-trades engineer who dabbles in a bit of everything.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_oTFZ" id="my-journey-with-hertzbeat">My Journey with HertzBeat<a href="https://hertzbeat.apache.org/blog/2025/06/29/new-committer#my-journey-with-hertzbeat" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Initially, while setting up several services for myself, I needed a way to visualize metrics but didn't want to introduce overly complex monitoring systems. I hoped to find an out-of-the-box monitoring tool that was comprehensive and easy to extend – that’s when I discovered HertzBeat.</p>
<p>As I used it more deeply, I began exploring its source code and developed a desire to contribute to the community. I still vividly remember the anticipation during my first pull request (PR), going through multiple rounds of debugging and verification, eagerly hoping it would be accepted into the main branch. With increased involvement, tracking community updates has gradually become a daily habit.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_oTFZ" id="welcoming-community-atmosphere">Welcoming Community Atmosphere<a href="https://hertzbeat.apache.org/blog/2025/06/29/new-committer#welcoming-community-atmosphere" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The community thrives with activity, as code submissions and reviews pour in even during late-night hours. It embraces newcomers with open arms, ensuring that whether you're filing an ISSUE to report a bug or submitting a PR to contribute code, your efforts will spark thoughtful discussions and elicit detailed, actionable feedback.</p>
<p>Currently, HertzBeat is in a phase of rapid development, with capabilities such as metrics, logs, and tracing requiring continuous enhancement and refinement. If you're interested in contributing to open-source, this is an excellent opportunity to get involved.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_oTFZ" id="about-open-source">About Open Source<a href="https://hertzbeat.apache.org/blog/2025/06/29/new-committer#about-open-source" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>For me, open source is a vessel for technical passion; growing alongside the community makes for a profoundly meaningful journey.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_oTFZ" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://hertzbeat.apache.org/blog/2025/06/29/new-committer#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>A heartfelt thank you to <a href="https://github.com/tomsun28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">@tomsun28</a> for the nomination and guidance. I hope this encouragement drives me to make even more valuable contributions to the community. Finally, wishing Apache HertzBeat™ a smooth graduation from the Apache Incubator and may the community continue to grow and thrive!</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I have been engaged in Java backend development since 2022. Currently, I am working as a backend developer in a company and also taking on some operations and maintenance tasks.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_oTFZ" id="getting-to-know-apache-hertzbeat">Getting to know Apache HertzBeat<a href="https://hertzbeat.apache.org/blog/2025/05/22/new-committer#getting-to-know-apache-hertzbeat" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Last year, I came across the Apache HertzBeat™ project by chance. After reading the documentation, I found that this monitoring tool is easy to use, does not require an Agent, and can be operated entirely through a web page. So, I quickly set it up within the company based on Docker and put it into use.</p>
<p>Due to the <code>All in one</code> design architecture of Apache HertzBeat™, it has greatly reduced my mental burden, and I was able to quickly integrate various internal company services into the monitoring system.</p>

<p>During the usage process, I discovered a database query bug. So, I forked the code and started debugging it locally. I found that the fix was not complicated and since no one else had addressed it, I submitted my first PR. To my surprise, it was merged quickly, which greatly encouraged me.</p>
<p>In the following period, I continued to familiarize myself with the Apache HertzBeat™ code, paying close attention to ISSUES and PRs. As my understanding of the system deepened, apart from fixing BUGs and improving documentation, I also developed some new features, such as database storage templates and SSH tunnels.</p>

<p>I'm deeply grateful to <a href="https://github.com/tomsun28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">@tomsun28</a> for inviting me to become a committer for this project. I also want to thank other members of the community for assisting me in reviewing code and providing invaluable help. Apache HertzBeat™ boasts a highly active community, and I sincerely hope more people will join and contribute to it, Finally, I wish Apache HertzBeat™ can graduate from the incubator soon!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[From Contributor to PMC]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_oTFZ" id="from-contributor-to-pmc">From Contributor to PMC<a href="https://hertzbeat.apache.org/blog/2025/5/19/new-pmc#from-contributor-to-pmc" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>About a year ago, I discovered Apache HertzBeat™ - an agentless monitoring system with out-of-the-box features that immediately caught my interest through its pure web-based operations. After starting to use it, I made my first code contribution. When that initial PR got merged, my confidence in open source contribution skyrocketed. Since then, I've continuously looked for opportunities to contribute through documentation improvements, feature testing, code refactoring, and more in the community issue list.</p>
<p>As my contributions grew, I gradually evolved from an "occasional code submitter" to a "deep project participant". Fixing bugs, optimizing documentation, designing new features... This journey not only enhanced my technical skills but more importantly taught me how to collaborate effectively within a community.</p>
<p>After becoming a Committer, my responsibilities expanded beyond coding to include community discussions, PR reviews, and helping new members onboard. This experience gave me a profound realization: <strong>Open source isn't just about code - it's fundamentally about human collaboration</strong>.</p>
<p>This year, I was honored to be nominated as a PPMC member. Just like when I first received the Committer invitation, I felt the same excitement. I understand this recognition carries not just acknowledgment of past contributions but also the community's trust and expectations. As PMC, my responsibilities now include ensuring project health through strategic planning, community event organization, and requirement coordination. This role enables deeper involvement in core decision-making, from technical direction to ecosystem development, driving HertzBeat's continuous evolution.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_oTFZ" id="personal-growth">Personal Growth<a href="https://hertzbeat.apache.org/blog/2025/5/19/new-pmc#personal-growth" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>My deep involvement in open source over this past year has brought significant growth:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Learning Best Practices</strong>: Exposure to standardized code, excellent designs, and community best practices for tools like Git, CI/CD, and e2e testing</li>
<li class=""><strong>Collaboration &amp; Communication</strong>: Learning to write clear issue descriptions, participate in technical discussions, and resolve differences in distributed teams</li>
<li class=""><strong>Product Thinking Development</strong>: Understanding user needs of open source projects and transitioning from developer to maintainer perspective</li>
</ul>

<p>For the future, I plan to focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>User Support</strong>: Helping resolve user issues</li>
<li class=""><strong>Technology Promotion</strong>: Making Apache HertzBeat™ a top choice in monitoring through wider adoption</li>
<li class=""><strong>Contributor Ecosystem</strong>: Nurturing and developing more contributors for Apache HertzBeat</li>

<p>Apache HertzBeat™ is an open source real-time monitoring system emphasizing ease-of-use and lightweight design. It supports monitoring and alerting for servers, databases, middleware, and application services, providing a simple yet powerful solution for IT infrastructure monitoring.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[From Committer to PMC: The Transformation and Growth of Roles]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_oTFZ" id="from-committer-to-pmc-the-transformation-and-growth-of-roles">From Committer to PMC: The Transformation and Growth of Roles<a href="https://hertzbeat.apache.org/blog/2025/04/06/new-pmc#from-committer-to-pmc-the-transformation-and-growth-of-roles" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>A year ago, when I received the notification of becoming an Apache HertzBeat™ <strong>Committer</strong>, the joy and sense of mission I felt are still vivid in my memory. At that time, I was more focused on specific technical implementations and feature developments. Now, being invited to join the <strong>PMC</strong> means that I need to view the project's development from a more comprehensive perspective. This is not only an acknowledgment of my participation in open source but also a call for future responsibilities.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_oTFZ" id="in-depth-participation-accumulation-during-the-committer-period">In-depth Participation: Accumulation during the Committer Period<a href="https://hertzbeat.apache.org/blog/2025/04/06/new-pmc#in-depth-participation-accumulation-during-the-committer-period" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>After becoming a Committer, my daily work changed significantly:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Code review became the norm</strong>: From the initial simple PR reviews to the ability to systematically evaluate code quality, the rationality of the architecture, and consistency with the overall project direction.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Tighter community collaboration</strong>: I started to regularly participate in community meetings, assist new contributors in solving problems, and even take the lead in the development and implementation of certain features.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Participation in technical decision-making</strong>: On key issues such as monitoring protocol support and storage engine optimization, I began to put forward my own opinions and jointly develop implementation plans with the core team.</li>
</ul>
<p>During this period, I deeply realized that <strong>the vitality of an open source project lies not only in the code but also in community collaboration and trust</strong>. Every code merge and every problem discussion are minor adjustments to the project's direction, and the role of the Committer gave me the opportunity to be involved.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_oTFZ" id="becoming-a-pmc-the-upgrade-of-responsibilities-and-challenges">Becoming a PMC: The Upgrade of Responsibilities and Challenges<a href="https://hertzbeat.apache.org/blog/2025/04/06/new-pmc#becoming-a-pmc-the-upgrade-of-responsibilities-and-challenges" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The responsibilities of the PPMC go far beyond the code level. It requires members to have a deeper understanding and thinking about the project's <strong>technical direction, community governance, and long-term development</strong>. When I received the PPMC invitation, I felt excited but also realized that I needed to face new challenges:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_oTFZ" id="1-participation-in-technical-strategy">1. Participation in Technical Strategy<a href="https://hertzbeat.apache.org/blog/2025/04/06/new-pmc#1-participation-in-technical-strategy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>As a PMC, I need to jointly plan the long-term roadmap of HertzBeat with other members. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Performance optimization</strong>: In the face of large-scale monitoring scenarios, how to optimize storage and query efficiency.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Enhanced scalability</strong>: How to design a more flexible plugin mechanism to facilitate the community to contribute new monitoring types.</li>
</ul>
<p>These issues are no longer simple code implementations but involve in-depth discussions on technical selection, community resource allocation, and even project positioning.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_oTFZ" id="2-community-governance-and-health">2. Community Governance and Health<a href="https://hertzbeat.apache.org/blog/2025/04/06/new-pmc#2-community-governance-and-health" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>The PPMC needs to pay attention to the long-term healthy development of the community, including:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Contributor experience</strong>: How to optimize the documentation and lower the entry threshold for new members.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Community culture</strong>: Ensure a friendly discussion atmosphere and that conflicts can be properly resolved.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Sustainable development</strong>: Motivate long-term contributors while attracting new blood.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_oTFZ" id="personal-growth-the-transformation-of-skills-and-mentality">Personal Growth: The Transformation of Skills and Mentality<a href="https://hertzbeat.apache.org/blog/2025/04/06/new-pmc#personal-growth-the-transformation-of-skills-and-mentality" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>This year's experience has improved me in multiple dimensions:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Technical breadth</strong>: From focusing on specific functions to understanding the overall architecture of the distributed monitoring system.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Soft skills</strong>: Learned how to communicate effectively, coordinate different opinions, and promote community consensus.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Project management</strong>: Understood the operation mode of open source projects and balanced the ideal and practical constraints.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most profound realization is that <strong>in the open source community, technical ability is just the foundation, and the real value lies in whether you can create achievements greater than the individual through collaboration</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_oTFZ" id="future-prospects-moving-forward-with-hertzbeat">Future Prospects: Moving Forward with HertzBeat<a href="https://hertzbeat.apache.org/blog/2025/04/06/new-pmc#future-prospects-moving-forward-with-hertzbeat" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>As a newly appointed PMC, I have several key directions for the future:</p>
<ol>
<li class=""><strong>Promote HertzBeat to become an important choice in the field of cloud-native monitoring</strong>, especially to form a differentiated advantage in terms of lightweight and ease of use.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Build a more active contributor community</strong> and cultivate core contributors through mentorship programs, regular activities, and other means.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Improve the project governance process</strong> to make decision-making more transparent and participation smoother.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_oTFZ" id="acknowledgments-and-encouragement">Acknowledgments and Encouragement<a href="https://hertzbeat.apache.org/blog/2025/04/06/new-pmc#acknowledgments-and-encouragement" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>I would like to especially thank <strong>Tom</strong> for his guidance and all community partners for their support. The Apache Way emphasizes that "community is more important than code", and this concept has deeply influenced my way of working.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to share with you who are reading this: <strong>Open source is a long-lasting and warm journey. There is no need to pursue quick success. Just keep contributing, and the rewards will come naturally</strong>. I look forward to meeting more like-minded friends in the HertzBeat community!</p>
<p>As we often say: <strong>"Participating in open source is to make technology better, not to make life busier"</strong> —— Let's encourage each other 😊</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_oTFZ" id="behind-the-scenes-of-hertzbeat-how-metric-collection-works">Behind the Scenes of HertzBeat: How Metric Collection Works<a href="https://hertzbeat.apache.org/blog/2025/03/30/how-does-metrics-collection-work#behind-the-scenes-of-hertzbeat-how-metric-collection-works" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>HertzBeat is an open-source, real-time monitoring system designed for flexibility and ease of use. But how exactly does it collect, process, and store metrics from various systems?</p>
<p>In this post, we’ll walk through the internal architecture behind <strong>HertzBeat’s metric collection pipeline</strong> — from job distribution to alerting and storage — with the help of a high-level system diagram.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_oTFZ" id="hertzbeats-metric-collection-architecture">HertzBeat’s Metric Collection Architecture<a href="https://hertzbeat.apache.org/blog/2025/03/30/how-does-metrics-collection-work#hertzbeats-metric-collection-architecture" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="HertzBeat Architecture" src="https://hertzbeat.apache.org/assets/images/hertzbeat-metrics-collection-arch-7c804671e1309b2b4227976d69ad515c.png" width="2796" height="1256" class="img_e4d4"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Figure:</strong> High-level architecture of HertzBeat's metric collection system. The Manager handles job scheduling, alerting, and storage, while Collectors (external or internal) perform the actual metric collection. Communication between the Manager and Collectors uses a custom Netty TCP protocol.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_oTFZ" id="1-job-distribution-assigning-what-to-monitor">1. Job Distribution: Assigning What to Monitor<a href="https://hertzbeat.apache.org/blog/2025/03/30/how-does-metrics-collection-work#1-job-distribution-assigning-what-to-monitor" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>When the <strong>Manager</strong> component starts, it loads monitoring targets from the database. These targets define the host, collection interval, and other parameters.</p>
<p>To distribute the workload, the Manager sends jobs to <strong>external Collectors</strong> over a custom <strong>Netty-based TCP protocol</strong>. The <code>CollectJobScheduling</code> module handles this logic using <strong>consistent hashing</strong>, ensuring jobs are evenly distributed across collectors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 HertzBeat also includes a built-in <strong>main collector</strong> (identified as <code>MAIN_COLLECTOR_NODE</code>) that runs directly inside the Manager. This allows HertzBeat to operate in <strong>standalone mode</strong> without requiring any external collectors.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_oTFZ" id="2-task-scheduling-when-to-monitor">2. Task Scheduling: When to Monitor<a href="https://hertzbeat.apache.org/blog/2025/03/30/how-does-metrics-collection-work#2-task-scheduling-when-to-monitor" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Once a Collector receives a job, it registers it with the <strong><code>TimerDispatch</code></strong> system.</p>
<ul>
<li class="">For <strong>external collectors</strong>, the Manager sends the task via the TCP connection.</li>
<li class="">For the <strong>main collector</strong>, the Manager directly invokes <code>CollectJobService</code> within the same process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each Collector runs a <strong><code>Timer</code></strong> in a background thread, which schedules tasks according to their configured intervals. When the time is up, the timer triggers a <code>TimerTask</code> to begin metric collection.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_oTFZ" id="3-task-execution-how-metrics-are-collected">3. Task Execution: How Metrics Are Collected<a href="https://hertzbeat.apache.org/blog/2025/03/30/how-does-metrics-collection-work#3-task-execution-how-metrics-are-collected" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>When a <code>TimerTask</code> is triggered, it creates a <code>MetricsCollect</code> task and passes it to <code>MetricsTaskDispatch</code>, which places it in the <strong><code>MetricsCollectorQueue</code></strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li class="">A dedicated thread (<code>CommonDispatcher</code>) continuously polls this queue.</li>
<li class="">Tasks are executed by a <strong>worker thread pool</strong>, allowing multiple metric collections to run concurrently.</li>
<li class="">Each task uses a specific <strong>collector strategy</strong> (e.g., HTTP, JDBC, SSH) to fetch metrics from the target system.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_oTFZ" id="4-result-processing-what-happens-to-collected-data">4. Result Processing: What Happens to Collected Data<a href="https://hertzbeat.apache.org/blog/2025/03/30/how-does-metrics-collection-work#4-result-processing-what-happens-to-collected-data" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Once metrics are collected, the results are processed by the <strong><code>CollectDataDispatch</code></strong> module.</p>
<ul>
<li class="">If the task is recurring, it is rescheduled via <code>TimerDispatch</code>.</li>
<li class="">Results are added to a <strong><code>CommonDataQueue</code></strong> for further handling.</li>
</ul>
<p>For external collectors, results are sent <strong>back to the Manager</strong> via the Netty TCP connection. For the main collector, results are forwarded <strong>directly</strong> to the next processing stage without network overhead.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_oTFZ" id="5-alerting--storage-making-metrics-useful">5. Alerting &amp; Storage: Making Metrics Useful<a href="https://hertzbeat.apache.org/blog/2025/03/30/how-does-metrics-collection-work#5-alerting--storage-making-metrics-useful" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>The Manager receives metric data and pushes it into the <code>MetricsDataToAlertQueue</code>, where it is processed through two main pipelines:</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_oTFZ" id="-alerting">🔔 Alerting<a href="https://hertzbeat.apache.org/blog/2025/03/30/how-does-metrics-collection-work#-alerting" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<ul>
<li class="">The <code>RealTimeAlertCalculator</code> consumes metrics from the alert queue.</li>
<li class="">It checks each metric against user-defined alert rules and triggers alerts if conditions are met.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_oTFZ" id="-storage">🧠 Storage<a href="https://hertzbeat.apache.org/blog/2025/03/30/how-does-metrics-collection-work#-storage" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<ul>
<li class="">After alert evaluation, metrics are added to the <code>MetricsDataToStorageQueue</code>.</li>
<li class="">A background thread (<code>DataStorageDispatch</code>) processes this queue and stores the metrics in a database for long-term analysis and dashboard visualization.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_oTFZ" id="standalone-mode-no-external-collectors-required">Standalone Mode: No External Collectors Required<a href="https://hertzbeat.apache.org/blog/2025/03/30/how-does-metrics-collection-work#standalone-mode-no-external-collectors-required" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Thanks to the built-in <strong>main collector</strong>, HertzBeat can operate entirely in standalone mode. This is especially useful for testing, small deployments, or quick setup. All core components — job scheduling, collection, alerting, and storage — run within a single process.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_oTFZ" id="-conclusion">🧠 Conclusion<a href="https://hertzbeat.apache.org/blog/2025/03/30/how-does-metrics-collection-work#-conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>HertzBeat’s metric collection system is designed for <strong>performance, scalability, and flexibility</strong>. With its:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Queue-based, multi-threaded architecture</strong></li>
<li class=""><strong>Persistent TCP connections</strong> for reliable job/result flow</li>

<p>As a senior undergraduate student, my interest in open source began in my sophomore year. However, early attempts were challenging—even getting projects to run smoothly was difficult, which once made me hesitant to dive deeper. That changed when I discovered HertzBeat in a tech community.</p>
<p>HertzBeat's detailed contribution guidelines significantly lowered the entry barrier. Thanks to those who paved the way, I got the project running in just a few steps. Its graphical interface helped me quickly grasp the business logic. Later, I watched Tom's introductory video on Bilibili, which deepened my understanding.</p>
<p>Starting with bug fixes, I gradually explored the codebase through breakpoint debugging and log analysis. What kept me motivated was the community's responsiveness—my first PR was merged on the same day, and my GitHub ID appeared in the contributors list the next morning. This positive feedback loop was incredibly encouraging.</p>

<p>For developers looking to contribute, here are my suggestions:</p>
<ol>
<li class=""><strong>Start from a user's perspective</strong>: Use the project first, then identify optimizations like UI improvements (pagination, fuzzy search). Even typo fixes are welcome!</li>
<li class=""><strong>Technical debt treasure hunt</strong>: Search globally for <code>TODO</code>/<code>FIXME</code> comments to uncover "hidden quests" left by predecessors.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Watch Issues/Discussions</strong>: Stay updated through GitHub subscriptions or community chats. Engage in discussions and tackle interesting problems.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Documentation contributions</strong>: Fix typos, broken links, or missing translations—these are great starting points.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Enhance testing</strong>: Add unit/E2E tests to improve coverage and project stability.</li>
<li class=""><strong>Be proactive</strong>: Join developer groups, subscribe to mailing lists, or attend project meetings. Express your interests and align contributions with the project roadmap.</li>
</ol>

<p>Contributing to HertzBeat taught me the essence of geek culture—every line of code and detail is meticulously crafted, not just "good enough." This mindset has elevated my development skills.</p>
<p>Open source has also broadened my horizons. Previously, "Apache" only existed in my project dependencies. Through the community, I learned about the Apache Software Foundation's operations—and now I'm part of an ASF project myself!</p>
<p>Most importantly, I've connected with experts from diverse regions and industries. Their experiences are invaluable treasures to me.</p>

<p>GSOC, namely Google Summer of Code, is a global initiative launched by Google. It aims to encourage students to participate in the development of open-source software projects. Here is a detailed introduction:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">GSOC started in 2005. Initially, it was a project established by Google to promote the development of the open-source community and encourage more students to engage in the development and innovation of open-source software. Through this project, Google hopes to inject fresh blood into the open-source world, enabling students to enhance their technical capabilities through practice, and at the same time, bring new ideas and contributions to open-source projects.</li>

<p>Apache HertzBeat™ is an open-source real-time monitoring tool that supports a wide range of monitoring targets, including web services, databases, middleware, and more. It is characterized by high performance, scalability, and security.</p>
<p>With the continuous advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, integrating AI with monitoring systems can significantly improve their usability and interactivity. By developing an AI agent based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), we aim to enable conversational interaction for querying monitoring information, adding new monitoring tasks, and retrieving monitoring metrics. This will provide a more user-friendly and intelligent monitoring management experience.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_oTFZ" id="introduction-to-the-collector-module">Introduction to the Collector Module<a href="https://hertzbeat.apache.org/blog/2024/11/24/custom-development#introduction-to-the-collector-module" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading" translate="no">​</a></h2>

<p>The overall structure of the Collector module can be divided into four main parts, each responsible for different tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">
<p><strong>Collector Entry Point</strong>: This is the entry point for running the Collector module, from which collection tasks are executed after startup.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>collector-basic</strong>: This module mainly includes basic Collector implementations, such as monitoring for common protocols like HTTP and JDBC. The Collectors here typically do not require additional proprietary dependencies and can meet most basic monitoring needs.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>collector-common</strong>: This module stores some general-purpose utility classes and methods, such as shared connection pools and caching mechanisms, which other modules can reuse.</p>
</li>
<li class="">
<p><strong>collector-xxx</strong>: This is the extension Collector module for different services or protocols. For example, monitoring for specific services like MongoDB or RocketMQ often requires introducing their proprietary dependencies and developing within their respective modules. Below is an example of MongoDB's dependency:</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Through this modular design, the Collector can easily be extended to adapt to various monitoring scenarios.</p>

<p>To enable the Collector module to handle the Kafka monitoring protocol, we need to create a <code>KafkaProtocol</code> class to define the connection parameters for Kafka.
