            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Hello everyone, it's a great honor to be invited by the community to become Apache HertzBeat Committer.</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="self-introduction">Self-Introduction<a href="#self-introduction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Since starting my career, I have mainly been engaged in backend development work and have a great interest in open-source projects. I am currently employed at a financial software company and also undertake the management work of operation and maintenance.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="first-encounter-apache-hertzbeat">First Encounter Apache HertzBeat<a href="#first-encounter-apache-hertzbeat" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In our actual work, we have been using the monitoring system consisting of Prometheus and Grafana. As the number of devices and services to be monitored increased, and due to the limited number of operation and maintenance personnel, the workload for daily configuration and maintenance rose sharply, making it impossible for us to promptly handle and respond to user feedback.
At this point, we have been constantly looking for a lightweight open-source monitoring system. Apache HertzBeat is ready to use out of the box, has comprehensive functions, does not require an agent, is compatible with Prometheus, and fully covers all the protocols we currently use. Therefore, we quickly set it up and put it into use based on Docker internally.</p><p>As an open-source enthusiast myself, I encountered a few minor issues after using the software for some time. Since it happened to be written in a programming language I'm proficient in, I delved into the source code, endeavoured to refine the implementation, and contributed my improvements back to the community.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="the-path-to-open-source-contributions">The Path to Open Source Contributions<a href="#the-path-to-open-source-contributions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>I initially began using the tagging feature, only to discover right away that tag maintenance had an NPE issue. So I delved into the source code and gained a preliminary understanding of the cause. Following the official documentation, I submitted <a href="https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/issues/3605" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issue#3605</a> and created my first pull request to address it. Though a minor change, it was merged promptly, which proved immensely encouraging.</p><p>During subsequent, more in-depth usage, based on the actual monitored devices and scenarios, I primarily added several new monitoring services, such as <a href="https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/pull/3656" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache DolphinScheduler</a>, <a href="https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/pull/3715" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MacOS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/pull/3721" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Synology NAS</a>, amongst others. Collaborating with other community contributors, I refined and resolved the <code>jexl</code> keyword issue while also enhancing the status page functionality.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="community-engagement-and-growth">Community Engagement and Growth<a href="#community-engagement-and-growth" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Through daily contributions to Apache HertzBeat, I have also learnt how to collaborate more effectively within open-source projects. Communicating and working alongside community members has given me a deeper appreciation for the unique appeal of the ‘Apache Way’ and the spirit of open-source.</p><p>Becoming a Committer entails greater responsibility. Beyond continuing to contribute, it is vital to maintain a rigorous approach, offering constructive feedback and recognition to contributors, thereby helping more individuals participate in the community and grow within it.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="advice-for-open-source-developers">Advice for Open Source Developers<a href="#advice-for-open-source-developers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>For developers who are new to open source, first of all, please be brave to try and let go of your worries to take the first step. The process of making contributions requires time, but as long as you have patience, you will achieve results.</p><p>In the Apache HertzBeat community, by communicating more, many enthusiastic and friendly open-source contributors in the community can collaborate together. We can first gradually use and experience the functions, and start to attempt to contribute. For example, small contributions such as correcting spelling errors in the documentation and fixing incorrect comments, and then gradually deepen our understanding of the source code and try to fix the problems.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>My heartfelt thanks to all community partners for your patient reviews and thoughtful guidance. It has been a tremendous privilege to witness Apache HertzBeat successfully graduate to a TLP project during this period.</p><p>Becoming a Committer marks merely a small milestone for me. I look forward to continuing to uphold the spirit of open source alongside Apache HertzBeat, attracting more outstanding developers to jointly build a technologically advanced and vibrant community.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="personal-journey">Personal Journey<a href="#personal-journey" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In 2023, I stumbled upon the open-source project HertzBeat. At the time, I was still just following online tutorials and books to learn the source code of some well-known open-source frameworks.
With a mindset of learning, I attempted to run HertzBeat locally. However, I soon encountered an issue where the project wouldn't start. Because of this, I submitted my first PR—modifying the startup documentation.
This PR was swiftly merged into the master branch, which greatly encouraged me. From then on, I began to delve deeper into HertzBeat. It was challenging at first, and I didn't know where to start.
As I gained a deeper understanding of it, I gradually began to dissect its modules and code structure. During this period, I claimed numerous tasks and bugs from the community's issue list and submitted corresponding PRs.
From documentation, unit testing, frontend, backend, to new feature development, I unknowingly gained extensive knowledge within this project. This knowledge no longer felt cold and abstract like what's presented in books or blogs; instead, it came alive before my eyes.</p><p>A year later, I became a Committer—a new phase in my contributions to open-source projects. Beyond maintaining code, this role emphasizes proactively fostering a positive community atmosphere and mentoring new contributors to deepen their involvement with HertzBeat. This experience revealed that technology isn't just about code—it's about collaboration, sharing, and collective growth.</p><p>Today, I am honored to be invited to join the PMC. This recognition not only affirms my past contributions but also fuels my motivation to continue nurturing the community's growth! I sincerely wish Apache HertzBeat a healthy and enduring future.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="to-developers-interested-in-contributing-to-apache-hertzbeat">To Developers Interested in Contributing to Apache HertzBeat<a href="#to-developers-interested-in-contributing-to-apache-hertzbeat" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>For those considering open-source participation, I sincerely encourage you to build a solid foundation and cultivate genuine interest. Foundations enable you to quickly grasp new projects, while passion fuels your drive to contribute to open source.</p><p>Finally, hope everyone to actively engage with Apache HertzBeat and contribute to our community.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments<a href="#acknowledgments" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/tomsun28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom</a> and all the Apache HertzBeat™ community members for their support.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone, I'm Yang Chen, currently a graduate student at Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications. I'm deeply honored to receive recognition and invitation from the Apache HertzBeat™ community to officially become a project Committer. This marks the true beginning of my open-source journey!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="my-open-source-exploration">My Open Source Exploration<a href="#my-open-source-exploration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>As early as my undergraduate years, I had exposure to open source.
Back then, I developed a <a href="https://github.com/bigcyy/GroupNotifier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">epidemic notice QQ bot</a> based on the open-source <a href="https://github.com/mamoe/mirai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mirai</a> framework. However, that was more at the usage level.
In my junior year, I attempted to independently open-source an AI project called <a href="https://github.com/bigcyy/customized-chat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">customized_chat</a>, which was my first step into "open source."
But these experiences were all solo explorations, and I deeply felt that this wasn't true open source, as it failed to establish a complete community ecosystem.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="meeting-hertzbeat-true-open-source-practice">Meeting HertzBeat: True Open Source Practice<a href="#meeting-hertzbeat-true-open-source-practice" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>To participate more deeply in open source, I began searching for suitable open-source activities and thus encountered HertzBeat. For me, this was the true beginning of my open-source journey. Here, I not only learned solid technical development but also experienced a mature community ecosystem. I deeply understood the essence of the "Apache Way" - the community builds the project, not the project builds the community.</p><p>I first learned about HertzBeat through GSoC (Google Summer of Code), when the community's proposal about developing monitoring MCP deeply attracted me. So I proactively contacted Tom and officially began participating in community activities. Tom was very enthusiastic, and the entire community was exceptionally active.
I clearly remember my first PR (Pull Request), when I even conducted online testing with a user in an Issue, which was quite a unique experience for me. Although I wasn't ultimately selected for GSoC, during that period, I had already deeply participated in the community and fully experienced its excellence.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="growth-and-gains-from-open-source">Growth and Gains from Open Source<a href="#growth-and-gains-from-open-source" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Participating in open source has indeed significantly improved my abilities. By reading HertzBeat's architectural design and actively participating in community discussions, I've accumulated many valuable experiences, such as:</p><ul><li>Cutting-edge Technology: I gained deep understanding of monitoring system design and implementation, and practiced core technologies like concurrent programming and distributed systems in the project.</li><li>Practical Abilities: Through solving real problems and participating in code contributions, I successfully transformed theoretical knowledge into practical operational skills.</li><li>Community Culture Experience: I personally experienced the unique charm of the "Apache Way" and engaged in deep exchanges and learning with developers from around the world.</li></ul><p>My experience has convinced me that open source is not just about writing code, but an excellent platform for learning, growing, and contributing.</p><p>If you're also passionate about technology, eager to improve yourself through practice, and want to experience true community collaboration, then the Apache HertzBeat™ community is definitely your best choice!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="finally">Finally<a href="#finally" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>I sincerely thank <a href="https://github.com/tomsun28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom</a>, <a href="https://github.com/zhangshenghang" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shenghang</a>, <a href="https://github.com/zqr10159" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Logic</a>, and other community members for their meticulous code reviews and patient guidance. I hope Apache HertzBeat™ continues to thrive!</p>]]></content:encoded>

I'm a jack-of-all-trades engineer who dabbles in a bit of everything.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="my-journey-with-hertzbeat">My Journey with HertzBeat<a href="#my-journey-with-hertzbeat" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Initially, while setting up several services for myself, I needed a way to visualize metrics but didn't want to introduce overly complex monitoring systems. I hoped to find an out-of-the-box monitoring tool that was comprehensive and easy to extend – that’s when I discovered HertzBeat.</p><p>As I used it more deeply, I began exploring its source code and developed a desire to contribute to the community. I still vividly remember the anticipation during my first pull request (PR), going through multiple rounds of debugging and verification, eagerly hoping it would be accepted into the main branch. With increased involvement, tracking community updates has gradually become a daily habit.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="welcoming-community-atmosphere">Welcoming Community Atmosphere<a href="#welcoming-community-atmosphere" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The community thrives with activity, as code submissions and reviews pour in even during late-night hours. It embraces newcomers with open arms, ensuring that whether you're filing an ISSUE to report a bug or submitting a PR to contribute code, your efforts will spark thoughtful discussions and elicit detailed, actionable feedback.</p><p>Currently, HertzBeat is in a phase of rapid development, with capabilities such as metrics, logs, and tracing requiring continuous enhancement and refinement. If you're interested in contributing to open-source, this is an excellent opportunity to get involved.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="about-open-source">About Open Source<a href="#about-open-source" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>For me, open source is a vessel for technical passion; growing alongside the community makes for a profoundly meaningful journey.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>A heartfelt thank you to <a href="https://github.com/tomsun28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@tomsun28</a> for the nomination and guidance. I hope this encouragement drives me to make even more valuable contributions to the community. Finally, wishing Apache HertzBeat™ a smooth graduation from the Apache Incubator and may the community continue to grow and thrive!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Hello everyone, it's a great honor to be invited by the community to become a Committer of the Apache HertzBeat™ project.</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="self-introduction">Self-Introduction<a href="#self-introduction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>I have been engaged in Java backend development since 2022. Currently, I am working as a backend developer in a company and also taking on some operations and maintenance tasks.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="getting-to-know-apache-hertzbeat">Getting to know Apache HertzBeat<a href="#getting-to-know-apache-hertzbeat" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Last year, I came across the Apache HertzBeat™ project by chance. After reading the documentation, I found that this monitoring tool is easy to use, does not require an Agent, and can be operated entirely through a web page. So, I quickly set it up within the company based on Docker and put it into use.</p><p>Due to the <code>All in one</code> design architecture of Apache HertzBeat™, it has greatly reduced my mental burden, and I was able to quickly integrate various internal company services into the monitoring system.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="participate-and-contribute">Participate and Contribute<a href="#participate-and-contribute" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>During the usage process, I discovered a database query bug. So, I forked the code and started debugging it locally. I found that the fix was not complicated and since no one else had addressed it, I submitted my first PR. To my surprise, it was merged quickly, which greatly encouraged me.</p><p>In the following period, I continued to familiarize myself with the Apache HertzBeat™ code, paying close attention to ISSUES and PRs. As my understanding of the system deepened, apart from fixing BUGs and improving documentation, I also developed some new features, such as database storage templates and SSH tunnels.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>I'm deeply grateful to <a href="https://github.com/tomsun28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@tomsun28</a> for inviting me to become a committer for this project. I also want to thank other members of the community for assisting me in reviewing code and providing invaluable help. Apache HertzBeat™ boasts a highly active community, and I sincerely hope more people will join and contribute to it, Finally, I wish Apache HertzBeat™ can graduate from the incubator soon!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[From Contributor to PMC]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="from-contributor-to-pmc">From Contributor to PMC<a href="#from-contributor-to-pmc" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>About a year ago, I discovered Apache HertzBeat™ - an agentless monitoring system with out-of-the-box features that immediately caught my interest through its pure web-based operations. After starting to use it, I made my first code contribution. When that initial PR got merged, my confidence in open source contribution skyrocketed. Since then, I've continuously looked for opportunities to contribute through documentation improvements, feature testing, code refactoring, and more in the community issue list.</p><p>As my contributions grew, I gradually evolved from an "occasional code submitter" to a "deep project participant". Fixing bugs, optimizing documentation, designing new features... This journey not only enhanced my technical skills but more importantly taught me how to collaborate effectively within a community.</p><p>After becoming a Committer, my responsibilities expanded beyond coding to include community discussions, PR reviews, and helping new members onboard. This experience gave me a profound realization: <strong>Open source isn't just about code - it's fundamentally about human collaboration</strong>.</p><p>This year, I was honored to be nominated as a PPMC member. Just like when I first received the Committer invitation, I felt the same excitement. I understand this recognition carries not just acknowledgment of past contributions but also the community's trust and expectations. As PMC, my responsibilities now include ensuring project health through strategic planning, community event organization, and requirement coordination. This role enables deeper involvement in core decision-making, from technical direction to ecosystem development, driving HertzBeat's continuous evolution.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="personal-growth">Personal Growth<a href="#personal-growth" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>My deep involvement in open source over this past year has brought significant growth:</p><ul><li><strong>Learning Best Practices</strong>: Exposure to standardized code, excellent designs, and community best practices for tools like Git, CI/CD, and e2e testing</li><li><strong>Collaboration &amp; Communication</strong>: Learning to write clear issue descriptions, participate in technical discussions, and resolve differences in distributed teams</li><li><strong>Product Thinking Development</strong>: Understanding user needs of open source projects and transitioning from developer to maintainer perspective</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead<a href="#looking-ahead" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>For the future, I plan to focus on:</p><ul><li><strong>User Support</strong>: Helping resolve user issues</li><li><strong>Technology Promotion</strong>: Making Apache HertzBeat™ a top choice in monitoring through wider adoption</li><li><strong>Contributor Ecosystem</strong>: Nurturing and developing more contributors for Apache HertzBeat</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="what-is-apache-hertzbeat">What is Apache HertzBeat?<a href="#what-is-apache-hertzbeat" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Apache HertzBeat™ is an open source real-time monitoring system emphasizing ease-of-use and lightweight design.

            <description><![CDATA[From Committer to PMC: The Transformation and Growth of Roles]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="from-committer-to-pmc-the-transformation-and-growth-of-roles">From Committer to PMC: The Transformation and Growth of Roles<a href="#from-committer-to-pmc-the-transformation-and-growth-of-roles" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>A year ago, when I received the notification of becoming an Apache HertzBeat™ <strong>Committer</strong>, the joy and sense of mission I felt are still vivid in my memory. At that time, I was more focused on specific technical implementations and feature developments. Now, being invited to join the <strong>PMC</strong> means that I need to view the project's development from a more comprehensive perspective. This is not only an acknowledgment of my participation in open source but also a call for future responsibilities.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="in-depth-participation-accumulation-during-the-committer-period">In-depth Participation: Accumulation during the Committer Period<a href="#in-depth-participation-accumulation-during-the-committer-period" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>After becoming a Committer, my daily work changed significantly:</p><ul><li><strong>Code review became the norm</strong>: From the initial simple PR reviews to the ability to systematically evaluate code quality, the rationality of the architecture, and consistency with the overall project direction.</li><li><strong>Tighter community collaboration</strong>: I started to regularly participate in community meetings, assist new contributors in solving problems, and even take the lead in the development and implementation of certain features.</li><li><strong>Participation in technical decision-making</strong>: On key issues such as monitoring protocol support and storage engine optimization, I began to put forward my own opinions and jointly develop implementation plans with the core team.</li></ul><p>During this period, I deeply realized that <strong>the vitality of an open source project lies not only in the code but also in community collaboration and trust</strong>. Every code merge and every problem discussion are minor adjustments to the project's direction, and the role of the Committer gave me the opportunity to be involved.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="becoming-a-pmc-the-upgrade-of-responsibilities-and-challenges">Becoming a PMC: The Upgrade of Responsibilities and Challenges<a href="#becoming-a-pmc-the-upgrade-of-responsibilities-and-challenges" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The responsibilities of the PPMC go far beyond the code level. It requires members to have a deeper understanding and thinking about the project's <strong>technical direction, community governance, and long-term development</strong>. When I received the PPMC invitation, I felt excited but also realized that I needed to face new challenges:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="1-participation-in-technical-strategy">1. Participation in Technical Strategy<a href="#1-participation-in-technical-strategy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>As a PMC, I need to jointly plan the long-term roadmap of HertzBeat with other members. For example:</p><ul><li><strong>Performance optimization</strong>: In the face of large-scale monitoring scenarios, how to optimize storage and query efficiency.</li><li><strong>Enhanced scalability</strong>: How to design a more flexible plugin mechanism to facilitate the community to contribute new monitoring types.</li></ul><p>These issues are no longer simple code implementations but involve in-depth discussions on technical selection, community resource allocation, and even project positioning.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="2-community-governance-and-health">2. Community Governance and Health<a href="#2-community-governance-and-health" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The PPMC needs to pay attention to the long-term healthy development of the community, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Contributor experience</strong>: How to optimize the documentation and lower the entry threshold for new members.</li><li><strong>Community culture</strong>: Ensure a friendly discussion atmosphere and that conflicts can be properly resolved.</li><li><strong>Sustainable development</strong>: Motivate long-term contributors while attracting new blood.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="personal-growth-the-transformation-of-skills-and-mentality">Personal Growth: The Transformation of Skills and Mentality<a href="#personal-growth-the-transformation-of-skills-and-mentality" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>This year's experience has improved me in multiple dimensions:</p><ul><li><strong>Technical breadth</strong>: From focusing on specific functions to understanding the overall architecture of the distributed monitoring system.</li><li><strong>Soft skills</strong>: Learned how to communicate effectively, coordinate different opinions, and promote community consensus.</li><li><strong>Project management</strong>: Understood the operation mode of open source projects and balanced the ideal and practical constraints.</li></ul><p>The most profound realization is that <strong>in the open source community, technical ability is just the foundation, and the real value lies in whether you can create achievements greater than the individual through collaboration</strong>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="future-prospects-moving-forward-with-hertzbeat">Future Prospects: Moving Forward with HertzBeat<a href="#future-prospects-moving-forward-with-hertzbeat" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>As a newly appointed PMC, I have several key directions for the future:</p><ol><li><strong>Promote HertzBeat to become an important choice in the field of cloud-native monitoring</strong>, especially to form a differentiated advantage in terms of lightweight and ease of use.</li><li><strong>Build a more active contributor community</strong> and cultivate core contributors through mentorship programs, regular activities, and other means.</li><li><strong>Improve the project governance process</strong> to make decision-making more transparent and participation smoother.</li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="acknowledgments-and-encouragement">Acknowledgments and Encouragement<a href="#acknowledgments-and-encouragement" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>I would like to especially thank <strong>Tom</strong> for his guidance and all community partners for their support. The Apache Way emphasizes that "community is more important than code", and this concept has deeply influenced my way of working.</p><p>Finally, I want to share with you who are reading this: <strong>Open source is a long-lasting and warm journey. There is no need to pursue quick success. Just keep contributing, and the rewards will come naturally</strong>. I look forward to meeting more like-minded friends in the HertzBeat community!</p><p>As we often say: <strong>"Participating in open source is to make technology better, not to make life busier"</strong> —— Let's encourage each other 😊</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>🎉 Hello everyone. I'm very glad to receive an invitation from the Apache HertzBeat™ community and officially become a Committer of the project!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="my-open-source-journey">My Open Source Journey<a href="#my-open-source-journey" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>As a senior undergraduate student, my interest in open source began in my sophomore year. However, early attempts were challenging—even getting projects to run smoothly was difficult, which once made me hesitant to dive deeper. That changed when I discovered HertzBeat in a tech community.</p><p>HertzBeat's detailed contribution guidelines significantly lowered the entry barrier. Thanks to those who paved the way, I got the project running in just a few steps. Its graphical interface helped me quickly grasp the business logic. Later, I watched Tom's introductory video on Bilibili, which deepened my understanding.</p><p>Starting with bug fixes, I gradually explored the codebase through breakpoint debugging and log analysis. What kept me motivated was the community's responsiveness—my first PR was merged on the same day, and my GitHub ID appeared in the contributors list the next morning. This positive feedback loop was incredibly encouraging.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="entry-points-for-open-source-participation">Entry Points for Open Source Participation<a href="#entry-points-for-open-source-participation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>For developers looking to contribute, here are my suggestions:</p><ol><li><strong>Start from a user's perspective</strong>: Use the project first, then identify optimizations like UI improvements (pagination, fuzzy search). Even typo fixes are welcome!</li><li><strong>Technical debt treasure hunt</strong>: Search globally for <code>TODO</code>/<code>FIXME</code> comments to uncover "hidden quests" left by predecessors.</li><li><strong>Watch Issues/Discussions</strong>: Stay updated through GitHub subscriptions or community chats. Engage in discussions and tackle interesting problems.</li><li><strong>Documentation contributions</strong>: Fix typos, broken links, or missing translations—these are great starting points.</li><li><strong>Enhance testing</strong>: Add unit/E2E tests to improve coverage and project stability.</li><li><strong>Be proactive</strong>: Join developer groups, subscribe to mailing lists, or attend project meetings. Express your interests and align contributions with the project roadmap.</li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="personal-growth">Personal Growth<a href="#personal-growth" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Contributing to HertzBeat taught me the essence of geek culture—every line of code and detail is meticulously crafted, not just "good enough." This mindset has elevated my development skills.</p><p>Open source has also broadened my horizons. Previously, "Apache" only existed in my project dependencies. Through the community, I learned about the Apache Software Foundation's operations—and now I'm part of an ASF project myself!</p><p>Most importantly, I've connected with experts from diverse regions and industries. Their experiences are invaluable treasures to me.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts<a href="#closing-thoughts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Thank you to the community and everyone who reviewed my code! Wishing Apache HertzBeat™ a successful graduation from the Apache Incubator and continued growth! 🚀</p>]]></content:encoded>

I am deeply honored to become a Committer for the Apache HertzBeat™ project.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="my-journey-with-apache-hertzbeat">My Journey with Apache HertzBeat<a href="#my-journey-with-apache-hertzbeat" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>I came across the HertzBeat project through this year's <a href="https://summer-ospp.ac.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Source Promotion Plan</a> event. I was thrilled by the project's introduction, which mentioned "Agentless" and "Full web-based operation." I thought to myself, could monitoring really be this simple? At the time, our lab had just set up a new server, which I used to monitor with this project.</p><p>The project also supports one-click deployment via Docker, making it incredibly easy to get started. The refreshing interface also caught my eye. After using it, I was deeply attracted by the project's simplicity, ease of use, and comprehensive monitoring features. Moreover, issues and PRs in the project were responded to quickly, which motivated me to get involved in the project's development.</p><p>Contributing to a project takes time, so the first step was to thoroughly understand it. I usually start with the project documentation. It so happened that there was an issue about improving the documentation, so I took it on. By referencing the user interface, examining the source code, and following the existing document format, I successfully submitted my first PR to the project.</p><p>As I dug deeper, I added <a href="https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/pull/1947" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a monitoring template for OpenAI accounts via the HTTP protocol</a>. Later, I implemented <a href="https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/pull/2059" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">support for the IMAP protocol</a> and features to <a href="https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/pull/2313" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">monitor systems directly via script commands on Windows and Linux</a>.</p><p>During this time, I also submitted several minor fixes and feature PRs, such as <a href="https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/pull/2065" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">correctly displaying the monitoring status after creating, modifying, or restarting monitoring</a> and <a href="https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/pull/1978" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">implementing cascading parameter lists on the front-end</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="experience-sharing-university-students-participating-in-open-source">Experience Sharing: University Students Participating in Open Source<a href="#experience-sharing-university-students-participating-in-open-source" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>University students can learn excellent coding styles and design patterns from projects while participating in real-world development.</p><p>Passion is the best motivation.

In my daily work, I not only focus on code quality and system performance but also actively participate in the design and optimization of technical solutions.</p><p>Besides work, I am also passionate about the open-source community. Participating in open-source projects not only allows me to continuously learn new technologies and best practices but also helps me meet like-minded developers and jointly promote technological advancement. Becoming a Committer for Apache HertzBeat™ is an important milestone in my open-source journey, and I will continue to strive to make more contributions to the project and community.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="participating-in-the-apache-community">Participating in the Apache Community<a href="#participating-in-the-apache-community" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The first Apache project I participated in was Apache ShenYu (<a href="https://github.com/apache/shenyu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/apache/shenyu</a>). As an API gateway project, ShenYu provided me with an opportunity to gain a deep understanding of microservice architecture and gateway technology. Through my involvement in ShenYu's development, I not only enhanced my technical skills but also learned about the collaboration methods and open-source spirit of the Apache community.</p><p>This experience gave me a deeper understanding of the Apache community and laid the foundation for my later participation in other Apache projects, such as HertzBeat. From ShenYu to HertzBeat, I gradually deepened my understanding and contribution to Apache projects, eventually becoming a Committer for HertzBeat.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="encountering-hertzbeat-and-starting-to-contribute">Encountering HertzBeat and Starting to Contribute<a href="#encountering-hertzbeat-and-starting-to-contribute" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>After participating in the Apache ShenYu project, I gained a deeper understanding of how open-source communities operate. At this time, I came across the Apache HertzBeat™ project by chance, which aims to create an easy-to-use, high-performance open-source real-time monitoring and alerting system.</p><p>HertzBeat's philosophy and functionality immediately caught my interest. As a backend development engineer, I deeply understand the importance of monitoring systems in modern software architecture. HertzBeat not only provides rich monitoring features but also focuses on user experience and scalability, which aligns very well with my technical philosophy.</p><p>With enthusiasm for the project, I began to delve into HertzBeat's codebase and documentation. I found many interesting challenges and areas for improvement in the project, which sparked my desire to contribute. After gradually familiarizing myself with the project structure and contribution process, I contributed my accumulated experience in monitoring various relational databases, NoSQL, and other middleware from my work to the project.</p><p>As my understanding of the project deepened, I began to try solving more complex problems, such as performance optimization and new feature development. Each contribution not only taught me new knowledge but also made me feel the power and warmth of the open-source community. The feedback and support from project maintainers and other contributors further convinced me that participating in HertzBeat was the right choice.</p><p>Through continuous contributions and interactions with community members, I gradually became an active member of the HertzBeat community. This experience not only improved my technical skills but also gave me a deep understanding of the open-source spirit and the importance of collaboration. It was these ongoing contributions and participation that ultimately led to my nomination as a Committer for HertzBeat.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Becoming a Committer for Apache HertzBeat™ is an important milestone in my open-source journey. I will continue to strive to make more contributions to the project and community, while also looking forward to growing and progressing together with more team members, jointly promoting the prosperity and development of the project.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The scene at that time is still vivid in my mind.</p><p>In retrospect, my first official Github Pull Request was to remove a redundant Pom dependency for the Spring Cloud Alibaba project. I was very busy at the time, and after more than two hours of figuring it out, I finally submitted the first Pull Request successfully. I am very grateful to <a href="https://github.com/steverao" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheng Pu</a>, who introduced me to open source and took the crucial first step in participating in open source.</p><p>From the initial rush of using Git, to now <code>git c -m XXX</code>, as well as participating in various PR/Issue on Github. Looking back, I have so many thoughts. I think life is nothing more than this. Learn and explore -&gt; use skillfully -&gt; make achievements.</p><p>From my junior year to the present, I still maintain my passion for open source and participate in open source. To this day, I am already a committer on three projects.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="participate-in-the-apache-community">Participate in the Apache Community<a href="#participate-in-the-apache-community" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://community.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache Software Foundation (ASF)</a> is an American non-profit organization that aims to support various open source software projects. ASF was originally formed by a group of developers of Apache HTTP Server and was officially established on March 25, 1999. As of 2021, its total membership is approximately 1,000. The name comes from a local Indian tribe in North America.<br>
<!-- -->This tribe is famous for its superb military literacy and superhuman endurance. In the second half of the 19th century, it resisted the invaders who invaded their territory. In order to show respect for this Indian tribe, the name of the tribe (Apache) is used as the server name.<br>
<!-- -->But when it comes to this naming, there is an interesting story circulating here. Because this server is based on the NCSA HTTPd server and is the product of continuous revision and patching through the efforts of everyone, it is nicknamed "A Patchy Server" (a patch server). Here, because "A Patchy" and "Apache" are homophones, it was finally officially named "Apache Server".</p><p>The above is an introduction to the Apache Software Foundation from Wikipedia.</p><p>The Apache Software Foundation was originally composed of developers who developed <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache HTTPd</a>. Starting from the Apache HTTPd web server project, they created many excellent open source projects, attracting Common open source enthusiasts around the world participate in the maintenance and iteration of the project. Projects continue to be retired, and new projects are constantly being hatched, over and over again. Only then did the Apache Software Foundation become what it is today.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Apache HTTPd Server Logo" src="/assets/images/4-7f27a1963a2a0f34e4798265ccd4eefc.jpg" width="500" height="250" class="img_D4Vg"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="first-contribution">First contribution<a href="#first-contribution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The first contribution in the Apache community should be to delete a <code>{@link}</code> code link to the Dubbo project. I'm ashamed to say that <a href="https://github.com/apache/dubbo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dubbo</a> is the first open source project I participated in Apache, and there are only 6 submissions so far. In May, I came into contact with the <a href="https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache Hertzbeat</a> project through <a href="https://github.com/LinuxSuRen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rick</a>, and started my Apache contribution from unit testing. road.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="get-nominated-and-become-a-committer">Get nominated and become a Committer<a href="#get-nominated-and-become-a-committer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>This nomination was recommended by PPMC Member <a href="https://github.com/zqr10159" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Logic</a> of Apache HertzbeatP(Incubating). Thanks to the Apache HertzBeat™ Team. I was successfully nominated to become a Hertzbeat Committer and got my own Apache mailbox.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Apache ID Email" src="/assets/images/3-af6b1c6b58b3851a44a826a7f0a59009.jpg" width="1481" height="510" class="img_D4Vg"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="the-meaning-of-apache-committer">The meaning of Apache Committer<a href="#the-meaning-of-apache-committer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>As the saying goes, the greater the ability, the greater the task. Becoming a project committer is not only a change of identity, but also an recognition and affirmation of one's own abilities. When reviewing the PR, my ‘LGTM’ is no longer a gray style, but has become blue (due to different personal Github themes, the execution color is also different). No need to wait for other Committer Approve CIs. It means that you have management rights over the project.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="PR approval" src="/assets/images/5-c361870647f85aa061df419ba755da8c.jpg" width="565" height="275" class="img_D4Vg"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="how-to-participate-in-open-source">How to participate in open source<a href="#how-to-participate-in-open-source" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Anyone who wants to do something needs an opportunity and a guide. Among the many Apache projects, there are many people who pay attention to the project's Issue List. The one time that remains fresh in my memory is: one night after writing the unit test of a tool class, I discovered a small bug. What I thought at the time was that there was too much contextual information and it was not good to write it in a PR, so I opened an Issue to record the context.<br>
<!-- -->How small is this bug? It was so small that I just created the Issue. After submitting the unit test and the code to fix the bug together, I refreshed the PR List again and saw a PR Title to fix the bug.</p><p>In fact, there is no shortage of people paying attention to the project, but more of an opportunity! Opportunities to participate in projects.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="the-apache-way">The Apache Way<a href="#the-apache-way" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p><a href="https://www.apache.org/theapacheway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Apache Way</a> pursued by the Apache Community. The community is greater than the code. A good community is often more important than excellent code. The components of the community include developers, users, etc. Users are the first users of the project code. A healthy community status is when users discover problems, then report problems, and finally solve problems during use.<br>
<!-- -->A more likely scenario is that a user reports a problem, switches from being a user to a developer, and solves the problem. And continue to participate in the maintenance of community projects.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="paths-to-participate-in-open-source">Paths to participate in open source<a href="#paths-to-participate-in-open-source" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Open source is often pure, and the Apache Foundation exists to protect projects and developers.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="apache-community-identity">Apache Community Identity<a href="#apache-community-identity" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Before contributing to the community, it is important to understand the community's definition of identity, where a project's Committers are located, and how to become a Committer. The Apache community has a clear definition of <!-- -->[Contributor Identity]<!-- -->(<a href="https://community.apache.org/contributor-ladder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://community.apache.org/contributor-ladder</a>. html): <!-- -->[Contributor Identity]<!-- -->(<a href="https://community.apache.org/contributor-ladder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://community.apache.org/contributor-ladder</a>. html). The Apache community has a very clear definition of <!-- -->[contributor status]<!-- -->(. html):</p><p>! <a target="_blank" href="/assets/files/6-0729cf03ad23c3dfa35048013fc5a156.jpg">Apache contributor label</a></p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="project-committer-nomination-criteria">Project Committer Nomination Criteria<a href="#project-committer-nomination-criteria" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>The conditions for a Project PPMC Team to nominate a Committer are different. Take Apache HertzBeat™ for example:</p><p>! <a target="_blank" href="/assets/files/7-305a8108fc8ad9644b9bd053a254ef80.jpg">Apache HertzBeat™ becoming committer</a></p><p>Each project has its own standards, and these standards are not set in stone and will be adjusted at each stage of the project.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="how-to-participate-in-open-source-1">How to Participate in Open Source<a href="#how-to-participate-in-open-source-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Next is the highlight of this section, how to participate in open source and get nominated as a Committer?</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="open-source-events">Open Source Events<a href="#open-source-events" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h5><p>Students, because of their special status, do not have the experience of developing large-scale projects and do not have the opportunity to cut their teeth in a production environment. Therefore, it is often difficult to get involved in open source and there is a lack of opportunities.</p><p>I think the best way to get involved in open source and get nominated is the <strong>Open Source Summer (OSPP) or Google Summer of Open Source (GSOC) events</strong>. After completing the topic in question, gradual familiarization with the project's features, code, and continued participation will result in a nomination. There is also no lack of students who are nominated to become project Committer directly after completing the topic.</p><p>The next step is to <strong>Improve your Coding ability</strong>, find the missing unit tests and code bugs in the project, and then submit PR to fix them. This is often difficult for students who are just starting out, and the Coding ability is often built up after optimizing the project code and understanding every change.</p><p>The ecosystem around a good project<strong>is often crucial</strong>. A good documentation allows users/developers to quickly get started and participate in contributing. Multi-language extensions allow the project to be used in projects built in other languages, expanding the project's audience. A good Example repository allows users to discover more ways to use the project. Therefore, participating in the construction of the Example repository and writing and translating documentation is one of the ways to familiarize yourself with the project and get nominated.</p><p>Finally, I would like to say that getting nominated is something that just happens. You should not participate in open source just for the sake of getting nominated, and you should never forget your original intention.</p><p>Project communities tend to welcome contributions in all ways: be it code, documentation or sermons.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="random-thoughts">Random Thoughts<a href="#random-thoughts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>I'm writing this post to commemorate the special occasion of becoming an Apache HertzBeat™ Committer, and to motivate me to get involved in open source in the future.
Keep up the enthusiasm, keep up the coding, and thank you for all the people who have helped me while I've been involved in open source. I wish Hertzbeat the best of luck in its incubation and graduation to become a top Apache project! 🎉</p>]]></content:encoded>

Recently, in the Apache HertzBeat™ project, I have contributed through a series of optimizations and feature enhancements, which have not only advanced the project but also improved my skills. Today, I would like to share my contribution experience and insights into my growth.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="starting-from-the-details-optimizing-visuals-and-interactions">Starting from the Details: Optimizing Visuals and Interactions<a href="#starting-from-the-details-optimizing-visuals-and-interactions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>I firmly believe that details determine success or failure. When I first joined the project, I began by optimizing the interface to enhance the user's visual and interactive experience. I refined the modal window layout of the monitoring selection menu to better align with user operation habits.<br>
<!-- -->I adjusted the header style and content layout of the monitoring details page to make information presentation clearer and more intuitive. Additionally, I unified the border-radius values of components and addressed issues such as missing internationalization translations, ensuring the consistency and completeness of the system interface.</p><p>These seemingly minor changes significantly enhanced the overall aesthetics and user experience of the system. Through this process, I gained a profound understanding of the importance of interface design for user experience and honed my attention to detail.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="delving-into-functional-modules-for-enhanced-capabilities">Delving into Functional Modules for Enhanced Capabilities<a href="#delving-into-functional-modules-for-enhanced-capabilities" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In addition to interface optimization, I actively engaged in expanding and enhancing the functional modules of the system. I refactored repetitive code within the system, abstracted common components, and improved code reusability and maintainability. These improvements not only simplified the development process but also reduced the cost of maintenance in the long run. Furthermore, I extended the capabilities of the multi-functional input component by adding support for password types and search types, further enriching its functionality and versatility.</p><p>During the process of implementing these features, I encountered numerous challenges. However, these challenges spurred me to continuously learn and explore new technologies and methodologies. By consulting official documentation and other resources, I gradually overcame these obstacles and successfully completed the tasks. This process not only enhanced my technical abilities but also deepened my understanding of the importance of team collaboration.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="emphasizing-user-feedback-for-continuous-product-optimization">Emphasizing User Feedback for Continuous Product Optimization<a href="#emphasizing-user-feedback-for-continuous-product-optimization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>I firmly believe that users are the ultimate judges of a product. As such, I continuously collect and analyze user feedback both within the company and in the community, using these insights to guide targeted optimizations and improvements. By refining search and filtering functionalities and adopting a consistent and concise set of interactive elements, I have consistently enhanced the user experience.</p><p>In this process, I realized the importance of a user-centric approach. Only by genuinely focusing on users' needs and expectations can we create products that meet market demands.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="looking-ahead-continuous-contribution-and-growth">Looking Ahead: Continuous Contribution and Growth<a href="#looking-ahead-continuous-contribution-and-growth" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Reflecting on my past contributions, I feel a profound sense of pride and satisfaction. However, I am also acutely aware of the many areas where I still have room for improvement and need to continue learning and growing. Moving forward, I will uphold the spirit of rigor, innovation, and user-centricity, continuously exploring and practicing to contribute even more to the Apache HertzBeat™ project. I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to grow and progress alongside my fellow team members, jointly driving the project towards prosperity and success.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="HertzBeat" src="/assets/images/new-committer-f8ad9cf268df899234aaeaef8541e294.png" width="1920" height="600" class="img_D4Vg"></p><p>Hello everyone, I am very honored to receive an invitation from the community to be nominated as a Committer for Apache HertzBeat. Let me introduce myself briefly. I have been working as a backend developer since 2019, mainly using Java. Currently, I am working at a network security company, focusing on the backend development of network security-related products.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="encounter">Encounter<a href="#encounter" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In my work, several physical servers are deployed, running various databases and middleware. Although we have deployed the Prometheus + Grafana monitoring combination, most services and servers require additional installation of exporters.<br>
<!-- -->As a result, this monitoring system does not cover the entire project. Sometimes, we only realize a service is down when it is too late. One day in April, I came across an article introducing HertzBeat. I was immediately attracted by its unique features, such as no need for agents and fully visualized configuration, along with support for one-click deployment via Docker. I quickly deployed HertzBeat and put it into use.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="familiarization">Familiarization<a href="#familiarization" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Due to the fully visualized operation, I quickly incorporated the servers, databases, and middleware used in the project into HertzBeat's management. Afterwards, the community was preparing to release the first Apache version and needed to supplement a large amount of documentation. I attempted to submit some documents to familiarize myself with the community's process for submitting code and documentation, and at the same time, I got familiar with the relevant parts of the code while supplementing the documents.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="trying-to-add-something">Trying to Add Something<a href="#trying-to-add-something" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The first major change I made was to enable HertzBeat to support querying metrics from NebulaGraph using NGQL statements. Additionally, I added a monitoring template for NebulaGraph clusters based on this protocol. The idea initially came from my own needs. When I submitted this idea to the community, I quickly received a response and affirmation from the community, which greatly increased my confidence in continuously participating in this project.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="joining">Joining<a href="#joining" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Due to my continuous writing of documents and contributing code, I started to become familiar with this community and this project, and began to make some of my own suggestions. Many of these suggestions were adopted by the community and released in new versions. After the first Apache version was released, I received an invitation from @tomsun28 and @TJxiaobao to be nominated as a Committer.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I am very honored to be able to participate in this project and be recognized by the community. I would like to thank @tomsun28, @TJxiaobao, @zqr10159, @tuohai666, @yuluo-yx, @crossoverJie, @zhangshenghang, and @pwallk for reviewing my code, providing guidance, and helping me. Finally, I wish Apache HertzBeat™ to grow strong and have more and more contributors participating.</p>]]></content:encoded>

At that time, I was looking for an open source project to monitor our company's related services. As a general monitoring project, Apache HertzBeat™ naturally came into my sight. I began to understand its architecture and functions by reading official documents and browsing the project's code base.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="start-contributing">Start contributing<a href="#start-contributing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>After having a preliminary understanding of the project, I found that it needed to complete the monitoring scope of the big data field, so I decided to start contributing some code. I started with supplementing big data monitoring. This not only helped me understand the project more deeply, but also gradually let other members of the community know me.<br>
<!-- -->I remember that the first Pull Request I submitted was to add a new Hbase cluster monitoring template. Although it seems insignificant, I was very excited when it was merged. This was a real interaction between me and the open source community and my first step towards greater contribution.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="in-depth-participation">In-depth participation<a href="#in-depth-participation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>As my understanding of the project deepened, I began to challenge some more complex problems. I read a lot of code, participated in daily discussions in the community, monthly meeting discussions, and actively spoke in issue/pr. These activities not only helped me improve my technical skills, but also gave me a better grasp of the direction of the project. I began to put forward my own ideas and suggestions, actively participated in design discussions, and proposed some new features.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="nominated-as-committer">Nominated as Committer<a href="#nominated-as-committer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>After a period of active contribution, I received a nomination from the community (tom) Committer. Becoming a Committer means that I will have greater responsibilities and authority. The nomination process is open and transparent, and every member of the community has the opportunity to express their opinions.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="experience-after-becoming-a-committer">Experience after becoming a Committer<a href="#experience-after-becoming-a-committer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>After becoming a Committer, my role has changed. Not only did I continue to contribute code, I also began to be responsible for reviewing other contributors' code, helping them solve problems, and guiding their contributions. This process has taught me a lot and made me more deeply realize the importance of community collaboration.</p><p>As a Committer, I need to find a balance between code quality and project development. I learned how to conduct code reviews effectively, how to provide constructive feedback, and how to deal with conflicts. These experiences have not only improved my technical skills, but also made me make great progress in communication and collaboration.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="mental-journey">Mental journey<a href="#mental-journey" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Looking back on the whole process, from the initial wait-and-see attitude to active participation, and then to becoming a Committer, I have experienced a lot of challenges and growth. Sometimes I feel confused because of technical difficulties, and sometimes I feel lost because my contribution is not accepted. But it is these challenges that make me constantly reflect and improve, and constantly improve my abilities.</p><p>In this process, I also received help and support from many people. The predecessors in the community gave me a lot of guidance and advice, and their selfless sharing benefited me a lot. I also met many like-minded friends. We participated in open source together, discussed problems together, solved problems together, and celebrated success together.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="personal-feelings">Personal feelings<a href="#personal-feelings" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Becoming a Committer of Apache HertzBeat™ is an important milestone in my career. This is not only a recognition of my technical ability, but also an affirmation of my contribution to the open source community. Becoming a Committer is not an end, but a new beginning. I still have a lot to learn and improve.</p><p>This process made me understand the importance of cooperation and made me feel the charm of the open source spirit. Open source is not only a way to share technology, but also a concept of collaboration and common progress. I am very honored to be a member of the Apache HertzBeat™ community and hope to continue to contribute to the development of the project in the future.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Becoming a Committer of the Apache HertzBeat™ project is a challenging and rewarding journey. Through continuous learning and contribution, I have not only improved my technical ability, but also found a sense of belonging and accomplishment in the community.<br>
<!-- -->I hope that my experience can inspire more people to participate in the open source community and jointly promote the progress and development of technology. To borrow the words of Tom: Participating in open source should not affect everyone's work and life, otherwise it will go against the original intention. Everyone should participate in the free time after get off work.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Currently, I am working as an infrastructure engineer at an internet company.</p><p>I have always been passionate about the open-source community, and I am also a Committer for Apache Pulsar and a Contributor for OpenTelemetry and VictoriaMetrics.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="my-connection-with-hertzbeat">My Connection with HertzBeat<a href="#my-connection-with-hertzbeat" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In April of this year, when HertzBeat entered the Apache Incubator, I happened to see a recommendation on a WeChat public account in my social circle.</p><p>My first reaction was that the name was really well chosen 😄.

Therefore, I read the documentation and quickly started it locally (the community has done a great job in this regard, as many open-source projects lose potential developers right at the initial startup step).</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="starting-contributions">Starting Contributions<a href="#starting-contributions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>My first PR was to fix an incorrect path in a PR template, and the community responded very quickly, which gave me a very positive impression.</p><p>So I started reading some of the core collection code of HertzBeat and found that many logics did not have unit tests at the time.

<!-- -->This is also our <code>HertzBeat</code> and other open source projects are not the same place, because the user group is more oriented to the operation and maintenance of the development, in our 139 contributors in the operation and maintenance engineers accounted for more than 30%, which breaks the open source project collaboration and contribution to the object are the inherent cognition of the development position, which shows that whether it is the operation and maintenance engineers and test engineers to contribute to the open source project participation is very enthusiastic!<br>
<!-- -->This shows that both operation and maintenance engineers and test engineers are very enthusiastic about contributing to open source projects, not just as bystanders to open source collaboration.<br>
<!-- -->Participation in open source projects is not exclusive to a certain group of people, but is open to all who want to participate, it may be a document, a script or a piece of code, imagine your participation in the open source project is deployed to thousands of servers to run running, to help others to be used or browse the Review discussion, git record will always be kept, this may be the significance of participation in open source projects.</p><blockquote><p>Welcome HertzBeat's newest community committer logicz, let's learn more about his open source experience!</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="logicz">logicz<a href="#logicz" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Nickname: logicz</p><p>Name：QingraZhao</p><p>Work：iFLYTEK technical support &amp; operation and maintenance</p><p>Hertzbeat Committer</p><p>github:zqr10159</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="getting-to-know-hertzbeat">Getting to know Hertzbeat<a href="#getting-to-know-hertzbeat" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In March 2023, I started to contact Hertzbeat, due to the need for a complete monitoring-&gt;alerting platform for the project, due to the deployment of the project on the intranet, the company's internal closed-source monitoring platform can not be developed to meet the needs of cross-network segment alerts.<br>

The component code is modular but does not support the independent deployment of the collector. The upper limit of the number of monitoring supported is naturally limited by a single node, and it cannot cope with the unified management of resources in multiple isolated networks.
After more than a month of iterations, we rewrote the collection task scheduling, deployed the collectors independently, and designed the stand-alone version and the cluster version to use the same set of codes to facilitate subsequent maintenance and upgrades. The two modes of the stand-alone cluster can be switched without perception. In the end, I am very happy that the cluster version met with you as scheduled.</p><p>The cluster version not only brings us more powerful monitoring performance, but also has functions such as cloud-side collaboration that are full of imagination.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="high-performance-cluster">High performance cluster<a href="#high-performance-cluster" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><ul><li>Supports the deployment of collector clusters, multi-collector clusters scale horizontally, and exponentially improves the number of monitors and collection performance.</li><li>The monitoring task is self-scheduled in the collector cluster. A single collector hangs up and migrates the collection task without perceptual failure. Newly added collector nodes are automatically scheduled to share the collection pressure.</li><li>It is very convenient to switch between stand-alone mode and cluster mode and deploy without additional components.</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" alt="HertzBeat" src="/assets/images/cluster-arch-f5cb9fea50e3ce406fb7b97d2c0add56.png" width="2360" height="846" class="img_D4Vg"></p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="cloud-edge-collaboration">Cloud Edge Collaboration<a href="#cloud-edge-collaboration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><blockquote><p>Support the deployment of edge collector clusters, and cooperate with the main HertzBeat service cloud to improve collection capabilities.</p></blockquote><p>In the isolated network where multiple networks are not connected, in the previous solution, we needed to deploy a monitoring system on each network, which resulted in the incompatibility of data and inconvenient management, deployment and maintenance.
HertzBeat provides cloud-edge collaboration capabilities. Edge collectors can be deployed on multiple isolated networks. When monitoring is added, collectors are specified. The collectors collect monitoring tasks within the isolated network, and report the collected data. The main HertzBeat service performs unified scheduling, management and display.
This is mostly used in unified monitoring scenarios of multiple isolated data centers or cloud resources and resources under the cloud of different vendors.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="HertzBeat" src="/assets/images/cluster-arch-f5cb9fea50e3ce406fb7b97d2c0add56.png" width="2360" height="846" class="img_D4Vg"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="why-open-source-cluster-version">Why open source cluster version?<a href="#why-open-source-cluster-version" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Often, some strategies for making open source products that need to be commercialized will be to use the stand-alone version as a toy for the beginners of small players, and then use the cluster version as a closed-source product for paid players who need it. This model can be said to be very good and worthy of recognition, that is, to ensure that open source can also get benefits, and it is also applicable to the development strategy of many open source projects, and it may be more smooth on the business path.
Some people on the Internet will sneer at such open source projects that are divided into stand-alone and cluster versions, thinking that they are pseudo-open source, and open source is a gimmick. They think that open source should be open source and free, and the open source team should contribute everything selflessly. . . . Very speechless people like this, there is only return for investment. When you use open source software for free and get value, should you think about what you have paid for open source software instead of just asking for it.
So back to the topic, why do we want an open source cluster version? Just because you love open source? If you say that we are still teenagers, you may believe this, but do you believe this when a person who is going to be 30 and has family responsibilities says this, I don’t believe it myself😂.
First of all, let's take a look at what open source can bring, or why open source should be done. The idea of full-time open source at the beginning is very simple, to make your favorite open source product (realized), the programmer's dream can be deployed on thousands of servers (see the downloads have been realized), and then make money based on this open source product ( not crying yet).</p><ul><li>User traffic. Open source projects are provided free of charge to users and developers, and have advantages in attracting users to use and promoting them.</li><li>User trust. Open source products are naturally easy to gain the trust and patience of users, or lower the threshold of trust for users.</li><li>Community collaboration. Open source products can attract top contributors to contribute together, receive user feedback issues, pr contributions, etc.</li><li>Driven by the community, open source projects will become better and better, and more people will participate and use them after positive feedback. Community collaboration I think this is the meaning of open source, and this is not just the contribution code collaboration between programmers, users are all collaboration objects (for example, our project has a large number of operation and maintenance friends who contribute code and documents), if it is only code Open source without community collaboration, it is better to release an installation package for others to use and download for free.</li><li>Product ecology. This is required for some ecological products, such as hertzbeat, which need to support monitoring types that connect to various types of protocols, and a large number of monitoring templates. Only a good open source project ecology can attract other contributors to contribute and share, exchange what is needed in the ecology, and ultimately everyone will benefit from the ecology. This is difficult to do in closed source programs.</li></ul><p>The above points focus on community collaboration and product ecology. This is also the reason for the open source cluster version. Only open source products can be rolled into stronger product power. For example, the technical feature of cluster will naturally attract developers (and the cluster itself is The product of our community collaboration) will attract more users and contributors to use feedback and iterate together. The community drives and then positively promotes open source projects and satisfies user functional experience.
As for open source commercialization, the premise of open source commercialization is to have a really good, popular, and widely used open source product, and then do commercialization on this basis to make money.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="install-quickly-via-docker">Install quickly via docker<a href="#install-quickly-via-docker" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct

<strong>Monitoring+Alarm+Notify</strong> all in one. Support monitoring web service, database, os, middleware, cloud-native, network and more.
Easy to use, full web-based operation, monitoring and alerting at the click of a mouse, zero learning cost.
More flexible threshold rule, timely notification delivery by <code>Discord</code> <code>Slack</code> <code>Telegram</code> <code>Email</code> <code>DingDing</code> <code>WeChat</code> <code>FeiShu</code> <code>Webhook</code> <code>SMS</code>.</p><p>We make protocols such as <code>Http, Jmx, Ssh, Snmp, Jdbc, Prometheus</code> configurable, and you only need to configure <code>YML</code> online to collect any metrics you want.
Do you believe that you can immediately adapt a new monitoring type such as K8s or Docker just by configuring online?</p><p><code>HertzBeat</code>'s powerful custom-define, multi-type support, easy expansion, low coupling, hope to help developers and micro teams to quickly build their own monitoring system.
We also provide <strong><a href="https://console.tancloud.cn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monitoring SaaS Cloud</a></strong>, users no longer need to deploy a cumbersome monitoring system in order to monitor resources. <strong><a href="https://console.tancloud.cn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get started for free</a></strong>.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Github: <a href="https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat</a></strong></p><p><strong>Gitee: <a href="https://gitee.com/hertzbeat/hertzbeat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://gitee.com/hertzbeat/hertzbeat</a></strong></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="v132">v1.3.2<a href="#v132" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Hi guys! Major release. HertzBeat v1.3.2 has published.</p><p><strong>This delightful version came out of the hard work of 27 friends. Thank them! Love 💗</strong></p><p>In this version, we support new monitoring types and metrics for <strong>freebsd, debian, opensuse, redhat, apache doris</strong>, etc.</p><ul><li>Support WEB page configuration mail server, replace the previous file configuration</li><li>Supports alarm convergence. If repeated alarms are frequently sent, it will be resolved immediately with alarm convergence</li><li>The public message queue supports Kafka. In addition to our default built-in memory message queue, it also supports an external Kafka message queue to improve system performance.</li><li>The new monitoring center page aggregates all monitoring types, no need to switch back and forth like before.</li><li>Support label group display, group and mark monitors of the same business category for unified management.</li><li>Threshold configuration not only has expressions, but also supports a more user-friendly operation UI. The previous expressions were not friendly to newcomers and were prone to errors. Now you can directly operate the UI, and it can switch between expressions.</li><li>There are many more functions such as HTTP ipv6.</li></ul><p>Fixed a large number of BUG, improved the document code, and improved the overall stability and usability. More new features are welcome to explore!</p><p>Let's Try Now!</p><p>Only one docker command is needed to install and experience hertzbeat：</p><p><code>docker run -d -p 1157:1157 --name hertzbeat apache/hertzbeat</code></p><p><code>or use quay.io (if dockerhub network connect timeout)</code></p><p><code>docker run -d -p 1157:1157 --name hertzbeat quay.io/tancloud/hertzbeat</code></p><hr><p>Upgrade Note⚠️.</p><p>For h2 database users, sholud exec sql below:</p><div class="language-sql codeBlockContainer_HDQy theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_UHnb"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-sql codeBlock_LL6a thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_ca6w"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">ALTER</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">TABLE</span><span class="token plain"> HZB_PARAM </span><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">DROP</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token keyword" style="color:#00009f">CONSTRAINT</span><span class="token plain"> CONSTRAINT_82</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">;</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">;</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_NUkr"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_cFFH" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_Uwwf" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_OHIc" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>How to Enable H2 WEB Console:

GreptimeDB to store the metrics data of the open source real-time monitoring HertzBeat, in general, the two open source products is very simple to get started, the key is that if it is too much trouble do not want to deploy both of them still have cloud services 😂 let you toss.
As one of the developers of the feature <a href="https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/pull/834" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HertzBeat supports GreptimeDB</a>, in the actual adaptation process, GreptimeDB's silky-smooth native SDK and relational database-like SQL, let us from other GreptimeDB native SDK and relational database-like SQL make it very easy to switch from other time-series databases like <code>TDengine, IotDB, InfluxDB</code> to GreptimeDB, and the experience is very smooth.</p><p>GreptimeDB Github: <a href="https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb</a>

I didn’t know until the user feedback. I urgently need a monitoring platform that can monitor the online rate of the website and give timely alarms.
After browsing several monitoring platforms, I finally settled on Hertzbeat, because it has powerful functions, meets the needs and has some surprises.
The most important thing is the code specification, clear comments, and consistent technology stack, which is convenient for the secondary development of enterprises.
Combined with powerful custom notifications, we have monitored databases, middleware, and websites, which have played a vital role in the stable operation of the company's platform.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="start-submitting-prs">Start submitting PRs<a href="#start-submitting-prs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The first PR was submitted on April 17, 2022, mainly for the problem of TDEngine time zone error found during the use process.

Grafana，但是学起来、用起来成本比较高，那个时候就觉得应该有其他类型的监控，恰好，到了大学毕业设计选题，我就开始寻找这方面的开源项目，那个时候我们小组正在使用Shen Yu网关，我就看了下社区，发现了hertzbeat，自此我便于它结缘了。</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_ylKo" id="开始提交pr">开始提交PR<a

In this version, we've added support for the SNMP protocol and implemented application monitoring for Windows operating systems using SNMP.
Another significant change is our default switch to using the H2 database instead of MYSQL for storage, making it easier for users to install and deploy. Now, you can install and experience HertzBeat with just a single Docker command: <code>docker run -d -p 1157:1157 --name hertzbeat apache/hertzbeat</code>

href="https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HertzBeat</a>, incubated by <a href="https://dromara.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dromara</a> and open-sourced by <a href="https://tancloud.cn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TanCloud</a>, is an open-source monitoring and alerting project with a user-friendly visual interface that supports monitoring types such as websites, APIs, PING, ports, databases, operating systems, and more.
Of course, we also provide a corresponding <a href="https://console.tancloud.cn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SaaS cloud monitoring version</a>, so small and medium-sized teams and individuals no longer need to deploy a cumbersome monitoring system to monitor their website resources; you can <a href="https://console.tancloud.cn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">log in</a> to start monitoring for free.</p><p>HertzBeat supports custom monitoring; by configuring the YML file, we can customize the required monitoring types and metrics to meet common personalized needs.
HertzBeat is modular, with manager, collector, scheduler, warehouse, alerter modules decoupled, making it easy to understand and customize for development.
HertzBeat supports more flexible alarm configurations (calculation expressions), supports alarm notifications, alarm templates, and timely delivery of notifications via email, DingTalk, WeChat, Feishu, etc.
Feel free to log in to HertzBeat's cloud environment, <a href="https://console.tancloud.cn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TanCloud</a>, to try it out and discover more.
We are rapidly iterating and welcome participation in joining and contributing to the open-source ecosystem.</p><p>The multi-type support, easy expansion, and low coupling of <code>HertzBeat</code> aim to help developers and small to medium-sized teams quickly build their own monitoring systems.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Repository url</strong></p><p><a href="https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github</a> <a href="https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat</a>
