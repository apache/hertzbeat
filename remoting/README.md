### Remoting
This is a server-client interaction implemented using the Netty framework, primarily intended for use in distributed scenarios, especially for facilitating communication between Manager and Collector components.

**Implementation is referenced from the [remoting module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/develop/remoting) of [RocketMQ](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq)**

**Special thanks to RocketMQ and Netty for providing the open-source code.**
