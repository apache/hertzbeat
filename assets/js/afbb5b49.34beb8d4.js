This model can be said to be very good and worthy of recognition, that is, to ensure that open source can also get benefits, and it is also applicable to the development strategy of many open source projects, and it may be more smooth on the business path.\nSome people on the Internet will sneer at such open source projects that are divided into stand-alone and cluster versions, thinking that they are pseudo-open source, and open source is a gimmick. They think that open source should be open source and free, and the open source team should contribute everything selflessly. . . . Very speechless people like this, there is only return for investment. When you use open source software for free and get value, should you think about what you have paid for open source software instead of just asking for it.\nSo back to the topic, why do we want an open source cluster version? Just because you love open source? If you say that we are still teenagers, you may believe this, but do you believe this when a person who is going to be 30 and has family responsibilities says this, I don\u2019t believe it myself\ud83d\ude02.\nFirst of all, let's take a look at what open source can bring, or why open source should be done.
