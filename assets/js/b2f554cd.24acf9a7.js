Committer!","permalink":"/blog/2025/07/11/new-committer"}},"content":"> **A Milestone Moment for Our Open-Source Project**\\n>\\n> On August 21, 2025, the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), the world\'s largest open-source software foundation, officially announced that Apache HertzBeat\u2122 has graduated to become an Apache Top-Level Project (TLP).\\n>\\n> Apache HertzBeat\u2122 applied to join the Apache Incubator in April 2024 and released its first Apache version two months later. On August 21, 2025, the Apache Board of Directors approved the resolution for Apache HertzBeat\'s graduation, ending a 17-month incubation period and officially establishing Apache HertzBeat\u2122 as an Apache Top-Level Project.\\n>\\n> This achievement signifies that Apache HertzBeat\'s technological innovation, community governance, and ecosystem maturity in the monitoring field have fully met the stringent standards of the Apache Foundation, making it a key choice for global open-source monitoring infrastructure.\\n\\n## 1. What is Apache HertzBeat?\\n\\n[Apache HertzBeat](https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat) is an easy-to-use, open-source, real-time monitoring and alerting system that requires no agent, features a high-performance cluster, is compatible with Prometheus, and offers powerful custom monitoring and status page building capabilities.\\n\\n![hertzBeat](/img/docs/hertzbeat-arch.png)\\n\\n### Features\\n\\n- **All-in-one monitoring, alerting, and notification**, supporting one-stop monitoring, threshold alerting, and notifications for application services, applications, databases, caches, operating systems, big data, middleware, web servers, cloud-native, network, custom, and more.\\n- **User-friendly and easy to use**, requiring no `Agent`. All operations are done through a `WEB` interface, allowing you to set up monitoring and alerts with just a few clicks, with no learning curve.\\n- **Configurable protocol specifications** such as `Http, Jmx, Ssh, Snmp, Jdbc, Prometheus`. You only need to configure a monitoring template `YML` in your browser to use these protocols to collect any desired metrics. Can you believe that you can quickly adapt to a new monitoring type like `K8s` or `Docker` with just a simple configuration?\\n- **Compatible with the `Prometheus` ecosystem and more**, allowing you to monitor everything that Prometheus can with simple page operations.\\n- **High performance**, supporting horizontal scaling of multi-collector clusters, multi-isolated network monitoring, and cloud-edge collaboration.\\n- **Flexible alert threshold rules**, with timely notifications via `Email`, `Discord`, `Slack`, `Telegram`, `DingTalk`, `WeChat`, `Feishu`, `SMS`, `Webhook`, `ServerChan`, and other methods.\\n- **Powerful status page building capabilities**, making it easy to convey the real-time status of your product services to users.\\n\\n## 2. Incubation Journey and Milestones\\n\\n### **I. Incubation Journey**\\n\\n- **April 2024**:\\n  HertzBeat officially applied to join the Apache Incubator and became an Apache Incubator project.\\n\\n- **June 2024**:\\n  The first Apache version was released, marking the project\'s official entry into the Apache ecosystem. (During this period, a large number of non-compliant third-party dependencies were replaced, such as the database JPA specification implementation being replaced from Hibernate to EclipseLink).\\n\\n- **August 21, 2025**:\\n  After **17 months of efficient incubation**, the Apache Board of Directors passed the resolution for HertzBeat\'s graduation, officially promoting it to an Apache Top-Level Project (TLP).\\n\\nUnder the guidance of the Apache Foundation Incubator, three major transformations were completed:\\n\\n- **Structured Governance:** Established a PMC-led open governance model, with community decisions made publicly through mailing lists.\\n- **Standardized Processes:** Adopted the Apache release process, with all versions approved by IPMC vote.\\n- **Global Collaboration:** Attracted developers and users from all over the world to contribute to Apache HertzBeat.\\n\\n#### **II. Technical Milestones**\\n\\nDuring the incubation period, Hertzbeat maintained an active pace of research, development, and iteration, releasing multiple versions to bring users richer features, more stable performance, and a better experience.\\n\\n- Released 5 ASF-compliant versions (1.6.0 - 1.7.2)\\n- Key feature enhancements include:\\n  - **Multi-protocol expansion** - Added support for key components or protocols such as Ipmi, PLC, NVIDIA, Redfish.\\n  - **Intelligent alert center** - Implemented multi-expression alerts, periodic thresholds, and alert suppression/silencing/dispatch functions.\\n  - **Dynamic service discovery** - Achieved automatic task discovery through http_sd and Zookeeper/Nacos.\\n  - **Cloud service integration** - Supported integration with alert sources from Alibaba Cloud SLS, Huawei Cloud, and Volcano Engine.\\n  - **AI capability enhancement** - Integrated AI platforms such as OpenAI.\\n  - **Storage optimization** - Upgraded storage performance for VictoriaMetrics and GreptimeDB.\\n  - **Internationalization support** - Added multi-language interfaces, including Japanese/Traditional Chinese.\\n  - **Data processing enhancement** - Supported SQL/PromQL expression syntax analysis, refactoring data flow with Apache Arrow.\\n\\nThe continuous iteration of these versions fully demonstrates Hertzbeat\'s dedication to technology and its high regard for user needs. Each version release is a solid step in Hertzbeat\'s growth, bringing users a more powerful and user-friendly monitoring experience.\\n\\n#### **3.

I\'m deeply honored to receive recognition and invitation from the Apache HertzBeat\u2122 community to officially become a project Committer. This marks the true beginning of my open-source journey!\\n\\n## My Open Source Exploration\\n\\nAs early as my undergraduate years, I had exposure to open source.\\nBack then, I developed a [epidemic notice QQ bot](https://github.com/bigcyy/GroupNotifier) based on the open-source [Mirai](https://github.com/mamoe/mirai) framework. However, that was more at the usage level.\\nIn my junior year, I attempted to independently open-source an AI project called [customized_chat](https://github.com/bigcyy/customized-chat), which was my first step into \\"open source.\\"\\nBut these experiences were all solo explorations, and I deeply felt that this wasn\'t true open source, as it failed to establish a complete community ecosystem.\\n\\n## Meeting HertzBeat: True Open Source Practice\\n\\nTo participate more deeply in open source, I began searching for suitable open-source activities and thus encountered HertzBeat. For me, this was the true beginning of my open-source journey. Here, I not only learned solid technical development but also experienced a mature community ecosystem. I deeply understood the essence of the \\"Apache Way\\" - the community builds the project, not the project builds the community.\\n\\nI first learned about HertzBeat through GSoC (Google Summer of Code), when the community\'s proposal about developing monitoring MCP deeply attracted me. So I proactively contacted Tom and officially began participating in community activities. Tom was very enthusiastic, and the entire community was exceptionally active.\\nI clearly remember my first PR (Pull Request), when I even conducted online testing with a user in an Issue, which was quite a unique experience for me. Although I wasn\'t ultimately selected for GSoC, during that period, I had already deeply participated in the community and fully experienced its excellence.\\n\\n## Growth and Gains from Open Source\\n\\nParticipating in open source has indeed significantly improved my abilities. By reading HertzBeat\'s architectural design and actively participating in community discussions, I\'ve accumulated many valuable experiences, such as:\\n\\n- Cutting-edge Technology: I gained deep understanding of monitoring system design and implementation, and practiced core technologies like concurrent programming and distributed systems in the project.\\n- Practical Abilities: Through solving real problems and participating in code contributions, I successfully transformed theoretical knowledge into practical operational skills.\\n- Community Culture Experience: I personally experienced the unique charm of the \\"Apache Way\\" and engaged in deep exchanges and learning with developers from around the world.\\n\\nMy experience has convinced me that open source is not just about writing code, but an excellent platform for learning, growing, and contributing.\\n\\nIf you\'re also passionate about technology, eager to improve yourself through practice, and want to experience true community collaboration, then the Apache HertzBeat\u2122 community is definitely your best choice!\\n\\n## Finally\\n\\nI sincerely thank [Tom](https://github.com/tomsun28), [Shenghang](https://github.com/zhangshenghang), [Logic](https://github.com/zqr10159), and other community members for their meticulous code reviews and patient guidance. I hope Apache HertzBeat\u2122 continues to thrive!"},{"id":"/2025/07/07/hertzbeat-v1.7.2","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2025/07/07/hertzbeat-v1.7.2","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/edit/master/home/blog/2025-07-07-hertzbeat-v1.7.2.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-07-07-hertzbeat-v1.7.2.md","title":"Announcement

Committer.\\n\\n## Self-Introduction\\n\\nI\'ve been working in development since 2019, engaging in various fields such as blockchain, cybersecurity, big data, new energy, and video technology. I\'m a jack-of-all-trades engineer who dabbles in a bit of everything.\\n\\n## My Journey with HertzBeat\\n\\nInitially, while setting up several services for myself, I needed a way to visualize metrics but didn\'t want to introduce overly complex monitoring systems. I hoped to find an out-of-the-box monitoring tool that was comprehensive and easy to extend \u2013 that\u2019s when I discovered HertzBeat.\\n\\nAs I used it more deeply, I began exploring its source code and developed a desire to contribute to the community. I still vividly remember the anticipation during my first pull request (PR), going through multiple rounds of debugging and verification, eagerly hoping it would be accepted into the main branch. With increased involvement, tracking community updates has gradually become a daily habit.\\n\\n## Welcoming Community Atmosphere\\n\\nThe community thrives with activity, as code submissions and reviews pour in even during late-night hours. It embraces newcomers with open arms, ensuring that whether you\'re filing an ISSUE to report a bug or submitting a PR to contribute code, your efforts will spark thoughtful discussions and elicit detailed, actionable feedback.\\n\\nCurrently, HertzBeat is in a phase of rapid development, with capabilities such as metrics, logs, and tracing requiring continuous enhancement and refinement. If you\'re interested in contributing to open-source, this is an excellent opportunity to get involved.\\n\\n## About Open Source\\n\\nFor me, open source is a vessel for technical passion; growing alongside the community makes for a profoundly meaningful journey.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nA heartfelt thank you to [@tomsun28](https://github.com/tomsun28) for the nomination and guidance. I hope this encouragement drives me to make even more valuable contributions to the community. Finally, wishing Apache HertzBeat\u2122 a smooth graduation from the Apache Incubator and may the community continue to grow and thrive!"},{"id":"/2025/06/10/hertzbeat-v1.7.1","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2025/06/10/hertzbeat-v1.7.1","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/edit/master/home/blog/2025-06-10-hertzbeat-v1.7.1.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-06-10-hertzbeat-v1.7.1.md","title":"Announcement

Committer of the Apache HertzBeat\u2122 project.\\n\\n## Self-Introduction\\n\\nI have been engaged in Java backend development since 2022. Currently, I am working as a backend developer in a company and also taking on some operations and maintenance tasks.\\n\\n## Getting to know Apache HertzBeat\\n\\nLast year, I came across the Apache HertzBeat\u2122 project by chance. After reading the documentation, I found that this monitoring tool is easy to use, does not require an Agent, and can be operated entirely through a web page. So, I quickly set it up within the company based on Docker and put it into use.\\n\\nDue to the `All in one` design architecture of Apache HertzBeat\u2122, it has greatly reduced my mental burden, and I was able to quickly integrate various internal company services into the monitoring system.\\n\\n## Participate and Contribute\\n\\nDuring the usage process, I discovered a database query bug. So, I forked the code and started debugging it locally. I found that the fix was not complicated and since no one else had addressed it, I submitted my first PR. To my surprise, it was merged quickly, which greatly encouraged me.\\n\\nIn the following period, I continued to familiarize myself with the Apache HertzBeat\u2122 code, paying close attention to ISSUES and PRs. As my understanding of the system deepened, apart from fixing BUGs and improving documentation, I also developed some new features, such as database storage templates and SSH tunnels.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nI\'m deeply grateful to [@tomsun28](https://github.com/tomsun28) for inviting me to become a committer for this project. I also want to thank other members of the community for assisting me in reviewing code and providing invaluable help. Apache HertzBeat\u2122 boasts a highly active community, and I sincerely hope more people will join and contribute to it, Finally, I wish Apache HertzBeat\u2122 can graduate from the incubator soon!"},{"id":"/2025/5/19/new-pmc","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2025/5/19/new-pmc","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/edit/master/home/blog/2025-5-19-new-pmc.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-5-19-new-pmc.md","title":"From User to PPMC Member: Contributing to Open Source with Passion at Apache HertzBeat","description":"From Contributor to PMC","date":"2025-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 19, 2025","tags":[{"label":"opensource","permalink":"/blog/tags/opensource"},{"label":"practice","permalink":"/blog/tags/practice"}],"readingTime":2.425,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"liutianyou","title":"liutianyou","url":"https://github.com/Liutianyou"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"From User to PPMC Member: Contributing to Open Source with Passion at Apache HertzBeat","author":"liutianyou","author_title":"liutianyou","author_url":"https://github.com/Liutianyou","tags":["opensource","practice"],"keywords":["open source monitoring system","alerting system"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Welcome HertzBeat\'s New Community Committer!","permalink":"/blog/2025/05/22/new-committer"},"nextItem":{"title":"HertzBeat Upgrade Guide (Docker Mode)","permalink":"/blog/2025/04/23/hertzbeat-upgrade-guide-docker-mode"}},"content":"### From Contributor to PMC\\n\\nAbout a year ago, I discovered Apache HertzBeat\u2122 - an agentless monitoring system with out-of-the-box features that immediately caught my interest through its pure web-based operations. After starting to use it, I made my first code contribution. When that initial PR got merged, my confidence in open source contribution skyrocketed. Since then, I\'ve continuously looked for opportunities to contribute through documentation improvements, feature testing, code refactoring, and more in the community issue list.\\n\\nAs my contributions grew, I gradually evolved from an \\"occasional code submitter\\" to a \\"deep project participant\\". Fixing bugs, optimizing documentation, designing new features... This journey not only enhanced my technical skills but more importantly taught me how to collaborate effectively within a community.\\n\\nAfter becoming a Committer, my responsibilities expanded beyond coding to include community discussions, PR reviews, and helping new members onboard. This experience gave me a profound realization: **Open source isn\'t just about code - it\'s fundamentally about human collaboration**.\\n\\nThis year, I was honored to be nominated as a PPMC member. Just like when I first received the Committer invitation, I felt the same excitement. I understand this recognition carries not just acknowledgment of past contributions but also the community\'s trust and expectations. As PMC, my responsibilities now include ensuring project health through strategic planning, community event organization, and requirement coordination. This role enables deeper involvement in core decision-making, from technical direction to ecosystem development, driving HertzBeat\'s continuous evolution.\\n\\n### Personal Growth\\n\\nMy deep involvement in open source over this past year has brought significant growth:\\n\\n- **Learning Best Practices**: Exposure to standardized code, excellent designs, and community best practices for tools like Git, CI/CD, and e2e testing\\n- **Collaboration & Communication**: Learning to write clear issue descriptions, participate in technical discussions, and resolve differences in distributed teams\\n- **Product Thinking Development**: Understanding user needs of open source projects and transitioning from developer to maintainer perspective\\n\\n### Looking Ahead\\n\\nFor the future, I plan to focus on:\\n\\n- **User Support**: Helping resolve user issues\\n- **Technology Promotion**: Making Apache HertzBeat\u2122 a top choice in monitoring through wider adoption\\n- **Contributor Ecosystem**: Nurturing and developing more contributors for Apache HertzBeat\\n\\n### What is Apache HertzBeat?\\n\\nApache HertzBeat\u2122 is an open source real-time monitoring system emphasizing ease-of-use and lightweight design.

HertzBeat: How Metric Collection Works","permalink":"/blog/2025/03/30/how-does-metrics-collection-work"}},"content":"## From Committer to PMC: The Transformation and Growth of Roles\\n\\nA year ago, when I received the notification of becoming an Apache HertzBeat\u2122 **Committer**, the joy and sense of mission I felt are still vivid in my memory. At that time, I was more focused on specific technical implementations and feature developments. Now, being invited to join the **PMC** means that I need to view the project\'s development from a more comprehensive perspective. This is not only an acknowledgment of my participation in open source but also a call for future responsibilities.\\n\\n### In-depth Participation: Accumulation during the Committer Period\\n\\nAfter becoming a Committer, my daily work changed significantly:\\n\\n- **Code review became the norm**: From the initial simple PR reviews to the ability to systematically evaluate code quality, the rationality of the architecture, and consistency with the overall project direction.\\n- **Tighter community collaboration**: I started to regularly participate in community meetings, assist new contributors in solving problems, and even take the lead in the development and implementation of certain features.\\n- **Participation in technical decision-making**: On key issues such as monitoring protocol support and storage engine optimization, I began to put forward my own opinions and jointly develop implementation plans with the core team.\\n\\nDuring this period, I deeply realized that **the vitality of an open source project lies not only in the code but also in community collaboration and trust**. Every code merge and every problem discussion are minor adjustments to the project\'s direction, and the role of the Committer gave me the opportunity to be involved.\\n\\n## Becoming a PMC: The Upgrade of Responsibilities and Challenges\\n\\nThe responsibilities of the PPMC go far beyond the code level. It requires members to have a deeper understanding and thinking about the project\'s **technical direction, community governance, and long-term development**. When I received the PPMC invitation, I felt excited but also realized that I needed to face new challenges:\\n\\n### 1. Participation in Technical Strategy\\n\\nAs a PMC, I need to jointly plan the long-term roadmap of HertzBeat with other members. For example:\\n\\n- **Performance optimization**: In the face of large-scale monitoring scenarios, how to optimize storage and query efficiency.\\n- **Enhanced scalability**: How to design a more flexible plugin mechanism to facilitate the community to contribute new monitoring types.\\n\\nThese issues are no longer simple code implementations but involve in-depth discussions on technical selection, community resource allocation, and even project positioning.\\n\\n### 2. Community Governance and Health\\n\\nThe PPMC needs to pay attention to the long-term healthy development of the community, including:\\n\\n- **Contributor experience**: How to optimize the documentation and lower the entry threshold for new members.\\n- **Community culture**: Ensure a friendly discussion atmosphere and that conflicts can be properly resolved.\\n- **Sustainable development**: Motivate long-term contributors while attracting new blood.\\n\\n## Personal Growth: The Transformation of Skills and Mentality\\n\\nThis year\'s experience has improved me in multiple dimensions:\\n\\n- **Technical breadth**: From focusing on specific functions to understanding the overall architecture of the distributed monitoring system.\\n- **Soft skills**: Learned how to communicate effectively, coordinate different opinions, and promote community consensus.\\n- **Project management**: Understood the operation mode of open source projects and balanced the ideal and practical constraints.\\n\\nThe most profound realization is that **in the open source community, technical ability is just the foundation, and the real value lies in whether you can create achievements greater than the individual through collaboration**.\\n\\n## Future Prospects: Moving Forward with HertzBeat\\n\\nAs a newly appointed PMC, I have several key directions for the future:\\n\\n1. **Promote HertzBeat to become an important choice in the field of cloud-native monitoring**, especially to form a differentiated advantage in terms of lightweight and ease of use.\\n2. **Build a more active contributor community** and cultivate core contributors through mentorship programs, regular activities, and other means.\\n3. **Improve the project governance process** to make decision-making more transparent and participation smoother.\\n\\n## Acknowledgments and Encouragement\\n\\nI would like to especially thank **Tom** for his guidance and all community partners for their support. The Apache Way emphasizes that \\"community is more important than code\\", and this concept has deeply influenced my way of working.\\n\\nFinally, I want to share with you who are reading this: **Open source is a long-lasting and warm journey. There is no need to pursue quick success. Just keep contributing, and the rewards will come naturally**. I look forward to meeting more like-minded friends in the HertzBeat community!\\n\\nAs we often say: **\\"Participating in open source is to make technology better, not to make life busier\\"** \u2014\u2014 Let\'s encourage each other \ud83d\ude0a"},{"id":"/2025/03/30/how-does-metrics-collection-work","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2025/03/30/how-does-metrics-collection-work","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/edit/master/home/blog/2025-03-30-how-does-metrics-collection-work.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-03-30-how-does-metrics-collection-work.md","title":"Behind the Scenes of HertzBeat: How Metric Collection Works","description":"Behind the Scenes of HertzBeat: How Metric Collection Works","date":"2025-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 30, 2025","tags":[{"label":"opensource","permalink":"/blog/tags/opensource"},{"label":"practice","permalink":"/blog/tags/practice"}],"readingTime":3.235,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"JuJinPark","title":"JuJin","url":"https://github.com/JuJinPark"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Behind the Scenes of HertzBeat: How Metric Collection Works","author":"JuJinPark","author_title":"JuJin","author_url":"https://github.com/JuJinPark","tags":["opensource","practice"],"keywords":["open source monitoring system"]},"prevItem":{"title":"From Commiter to PMC\uff1a The Journey of Growth at Apache HertzBeat\u2122","permalink":"/blog/2025/04/06/new-pmc"},"nextItem":{"title":"Warmly Welcome HertzBeat\'s New Community Committer!","permalink":"/blog/2025/03/10/new-committer"}},"content":"## Behind the Scenes of HertzBeat: How Metric Collection Works\\n\\nHertzBeat is an open-source, real-time monitoring system designed for flexibility and ease of use. But how exactly does it collect, process, and store metrics from various systems?\\n\\nIn this post, we\u2019ll walk through the internal architecture behind **HertzBeat\u2019s metric collection pipeline** \u2014 from job distribution to alerting and storage \u2014 with the help of a high-level system diagram.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### HertzBeat\u2019s Metric Collection Architecture\\n\\n![HertzBeat Architecture](/img/docs/hertzbeat-metrics-collection-arch.png)\\n\\n> **Figure:** High-level architecture of HertzBeat\'s metric collection system. The Manager handles job scheduling, alerting, and storage, while Collectors (external or internal) perform the actual metric collection. Communication between the Manager and Collectors uses a custom Netty TCP protocol.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 1. Job Distribution: Assigning What to Monitor\\n\\nWhen the **Manager** component starts, it loads monitoring targets from the database. These targets define the host, collection interval, and other parameters.\\n\\nTo distribute the workload, the Manager sends jobs to **external Collectors** over a custom **Netty-based TCP protocol**. The `CollectJobScheduling` module handles this logic using **consistent hashing**, ensuring jobs are evenly distributed across collectors.\\n\\n> \ud83d\udca1 HertzBeat also includes a built-in **main collector** (identified as `MAIN_COLLECTOR_NODE`) that runs directly inside the Manager. This allows HertzBeat to operate in **standalone mode** without requiring any external collectors.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Task Scheduling: When to Monitor\\n\\nOnce a Collector receives a job, it registers it with the **`TimerDispatch`** system.\\n\\n- For **external collectors**, the Manager sends the task via the TCP connection.\\n- For the **main collector**, the Manager directly invokes `CollectJobService` within the same process.\\n\\nEach Collector runs a **`Timer`** in a background thread, which schedules tasks according to their configured intervals. When the time is up, the timer triggers a `TimerTask` to begin metric collection.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. Task Execution: How Metrics Are Collected\\n\\nWhen a `TimerTask` is triggered, it creates a `MetricsCollect` task and passes it to `MetricsTaskDispatch`, which places it in the **`MetricsCollectorQueue`**.\\n\\n- A dedicated thread (`CommonDispatcher`) continuously polls this queue.\\n- Tasks are executed by a **worker thread pool**, allowing multiple metric collections to run concurrently.\\n- Each task uses a specific **collector strategy** (e.g., HTTP, JDBC, SSH) to fetch metrics from the target system.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. Result Processing: What Happens to Collected Data\\n\\nOnce metrics are collected, the results are processed by the **`CollectDataDispatch`** module.\\n\\n- If the task is recurring, it is rescheduled via `TimerDispatch`.\\n- Results are added to a **`CommonDataQueue`** for further handling.\\n\\nFor external collectors, results are sent **back to the Manager** via the Netty TCP connection. For the main collector, results are forwarded **directly** to the next processing stage without network overhead.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 5. Alerting & Storage: Making Metrics Useful\\n\\nThe Manager receives metric data and pushes it into the `MetricsDataToAlertQueue`, where it is processed through two main pipelines:\\n\\n#### \ud83d\udd14 Alerting\\n\\n- The `RealTimeAlertCalculator` consumes metrics from the alert queue.\\n- It checks each metric against user-defined alert rules and triggers alerts if conditions are met.\\n\\n#### \ud83e\udde0 Storage\\n\\n- After alert evaluation, metrics are added to the `MetricsDataToStorageQueue`.\\n- A background thread (`DataStorageDispatch`) processes this queue and stores the metrics in a database for long-term analysis and dashboard visualization.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Standalone Mode: No External Collectors Required\\n\\nThanks to the built-in **main collector**, HertzBeat can operate entirely in standalone mode. This is especially useful for testing, small deployments, or quick setup. All core components \u2014 job scheduling, collection, alerting, and storage \u2014 run within a single process.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### \ud83e\udde0 Conclusion\\n\\nHertzBeat\u2019s metric collection system is designed for **performance, scalability, and flexibility**. With its:\\n\\n- **Queue-based, multi-threaded architecture**\\n- **Persistent TCP connections** for reliable job/result flow\\n- **Built-in main collector** for standalone operation\\n\\nit handles large-scale monitoring workloads with minimal overhead and high efficiency.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### \ud83d\ude4c What\u2019s Next?\\n\\nIf you\'re curious to explore more:\\n\\n- \u2b50\ufe0f [Star the project on GitHub](https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat)\\n- \ud83e\udd1d [Contribute or open an issue](https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/issues)"},{"id":"/2025/03/10/new-committer","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2025/03/10/new-committer","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/edit/master/home/blog/2025-03-10-new-committer.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-03-10-new-committer.md","title":"Warmly Welcome HertzBeat\'s New Community Committer!","description":"\ud83c\udf89 Hello everyone.

I\'m very glad to receive an invitation from the Apache HertzBeat\u2122 community and officially become a Committer of the project!\\n\\n## My Open Source Journey\\n\\nAs a senior undergraduate student, my interest in open source began in my sophomore year. However, early attempts were challenging\u2014even getting projects to run smoothly was difficult, which once made me hesitant to dive deeper. That changed when I discovered HertzBeat in a tech community.\\n\\nHertzBeat\'s detailed contribution guidelines significantly lowered the entry barrier. Thanks to those who paved the way, I got the project running in just a few steps. Its graphical interface helped me quickly grasp the business logic. Later, I watched Tom\'s introductory video on Bilibili, which deepened my understanding.\\n\\nStarting with bug fixes, I gradually explored the codebase through breakpoint debugging and log analysis. What kept me motivated was the community\'s responsiveness\u2014my first PR was merged on the same day, and my GitHub ID appeared in the contributors list the next morning. This positive feedback loop was incredibly encouraging.\\n\\n## Entry Points for Open Source Participation\\n\\nFor developers looking to contribute, here are my suggestions:\\n\\n1. **Start from a user\'s perspective**: Use the project first, then identify optimizations like UI improvements (pagination, fuzzy search). Even typo fixes are welcome!\\n2. **Technical debt treasure hunt**: Search globally for `TODO`/`FIXME` comments to uncover \\"hidden quests\\" left by predecessors.\\n3. **Watch Issues/Discussions**: Stay updated through GitHub subscriptions or community chats. Engage in discussions and tackle interesting problems.\\n4. **Documentation contributions**: Fix typos, broken links, or missing translations\u2014these are great starting points.\\n5. **Enhance testing**: Add unit/E2E tests to improve coverage and project stability.\\n6. **Be proactive**: Join developer groups, subscribe to mailing lists, or attend project meetings. Express your interests and align contributions with the project roadmap.\\n\\n## Personal Growth\\n\\nContributing to HertzBeat taught me the essence of geek culture\u2014every line of code and detail is meticulously crafted, not just \\"good enough.\\" This mindset has elevated my development skills.\\n\\nOpen source has also broadened my horizons. Previously, \\"Apache\\" only existed in my project dependencies. Through the community, I learned about the Apache Software Foundation\'s operations\u2014and now I\'m part of an ASF project myself!\\n\\nMost importantly, I\'ve connected with experts from diverse regions and industries. Their experiences are invaluable treasures to me.\\n\\n## Closing Thoughts\\n\\nThank you to the community and everyone who reviewed my code! Wishing Apache HertzBeat\u2122 a successful graduation from the Apache Incubator and continued growth! \ud83d\ude80"},{"id":"/2025/03/03/gsoc-2025","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2025/03/03/gsoc-2025","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/edit/master/home/blog/2025-03-03-gsoc-2025.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-03-03-gsoc-2025.md","title":"GSOC Google Summer of Code 2025 Recruitment is Underway | We Look Forward to Your Proposals","description":"The Origin and Purpose of GSOC","date":"2025-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 3, 2025","tags":[{"label":"opensource","permalink":"/blog/tags/opensource"},{"label":"practice","permalink":"/blog/tags/practice"}],"readingTime":5.915,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"zhangshenghang","title":"zhangshenghang","url":"https://github.com/zhangshenghang"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"GSOC Google Summer of Code 2025 Recruitment is Underway | We Look Forward to Your Proposals","author":"zhangshenghang","author_title":"zhangshenghang","author_url":"https://github.com/zhangshenghang","tags":["opensource","practice"],"keywords":["open source monitoring system","alerting system"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Warmly Welcome HertzBeat\'s New Community Committer!","permalink":"/blog/2025/03/10/new-committer"},"nextItem":{"title":"How to Participate in Developing Custom Collectors","permalink":"/blog/2024/11/24/custom-development"}},"content":"## The Origin and Purpose of GSOC\\n\\nGSOC, namely Google Summer of Code, is a global initiative launched by Google. It aims to encourage students to participate in the development of open-source software projects. Here is a detailed introduction:\\n\\n- GSOC started in 2005. Initially, it was a project established by Google to promote the development of the open-source community and encourage more students to engage in the development and innovation of open-source software. Through this project, Google hopes to inject fresh blood into the open-source world, enabling students to enhance their technical capabilities through practice, and at the same time, bring new ideas and contributions to open-source projects.\\n\\n## Task: An AI Agent for Monitoring Information Interaction Based on the MCP Protocol\\n\\n**Website**: `https://hertzbeat.apache.org/`\\n\\n**Github**: `http://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/`\\n\\n### Background\\n\\nApache HertzBeat\u2122 is an open-source real-time monitoring tool that supports a wide range of monitoring targets, including web services, databases, middleware, and more. It is characterized by high performance, scalability, and security.\\n\\nWith the continuous advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, integrating AI with monitoring systems can significantly improve their usability and interactivity. By developing an AI agent based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), we aim to enable conversational interaction for querying monitoring information, adding new monitoring tasks, and retrieving monitoring metrics. This will provide a more user-friendly and intelligent monitoring management experience.\\n\\n## Functional Requirements\\n\\n### Query Monitoring and Alarm Information\\n\\n1. **Monitoring Item Status Monitoring**\\n   Be able to obtain the status of monitoring items through natural language;\\n   For example: Which monitoring items are currently abnormal? It should inform the user which monitoring items are abnormal and the time when the abnormality occurred.\\n\\n2. **Search for Metric Data**\\n   Be able to obtain metric data through natural language;\\n   For example: a. Which servers currently have a CPU usage rate exceeding 80%?\\n   b. Display the CPU usage of server 192.168.1.1 in the last day in the form of a chart.\\n\\n3. **Alarm Data**\\n   Obtain alarm data through natural language;\\n   For example: Which monitoring alarms have been more frequent recently?\\n\\n### Add New Monitoring Tasks\\n\\n1. **Add New Monitoring Targets**\\n   Be able to add new monitoring targets through natural language;\\n   For example: a. I want to monitor the response time of the web service.\\n   b. Please help me add monitoring for the database connection pool.\\n2. **Configure Alarm Thresholds**\\n   Be able to configure alarm thresholds through natural language;\\n   For example: a. Trigger an alarm when the web service response time exceeds 5 seconds.\\n   b. Send a notification when the database connection pool usage rate exceeds 90%.\\n\\n### Considerations During Design\\n\\n1. There are many data sources supported by the underlying storage. How to monitor? For example: Natural language -> SQL -> Query data source -> Large language model.\\n2. Compatibility with large language models, supporting commonly used models.\\n3. The usability of the solution, making it convenient for users to use.\\n\\n### Requirement Analysis\\n\\n- **Apache HertzBeat**: As the core backend of the monitoring system, it provides data collection, storage, and management functions.\\n- **MCP Protocol**: An open protocol that enables seamless integration between large language model (LLM) applications and external data sources and tools.\\n- **Front-end Interaction**: Develop a user-friendly interface that supports voice or text input and displays monitoring information and interaction results.\\n\\n### Recommended Skills\\n\\n- **Java + TypeScript**: Apache HertzBeat\u2122 is developed based on this technology stack. Therefore, mastering these technologies is crucial for integrating with HertzBeat.\\n- **SpringAi**: It is recommended to use SpringAi to build the AI agent.\\n- **LLM + MCP**: You need to understand large language models (LLM) and the MCP protocol. SpringAi seems to support the MCP protocol, or you can consider using the mcp-sdk directly.\\n\\n### Scale\\n\\n- **Difficulty**: Difficult\\n- **Project Scale**: Approximately 350 hours\\n\\n### Mentors\\n\\nIf you are interested, you can send an email to the mentors, including your solution and ideas.\\n\\n- **Gong Chao**: `gongchao@apache.org`\\n- **Zhang Shenghang**: `shenghang@apache.org`\\n\\n## How Can I Increase My Chances of Being Selected as a GSoC Contributor?\\n\\n1.

The Collectors here typically do not require additional proprietary dependencies and can meet most basic monitoring needs.\\n\\n- **collector-common**: This module stores some general-purpose utility classes and methods, such as shared connection pools and caching mechanisms, which other modules can reuse.\\n\\n- **collector-xxx**: This is the extension Collector module for different services or protocols. For example, monitoring for specific services like MongoDB or RocketMQ often requires introducing their proprietary dependencies and developing within their respective modules. Below is an example of MongoDB\'s dependency:\\n\\n  ```xml\\n  <dependency>\\n      <groupId>org.mongodb</groupId>\\n      <artifactId>mongodb-driver-sync</artifactId>\\n  </dependency>\\n  ```\\n\\nThrough this modular design, the Collector can easily be extended to adapt to various monitoring scenarios.\\n\\n## Adding New Collector Monitoring\\n\\nNext, we will demonstrate how to develop a new Collector through the practical case of creating a `kafka-collector` module.\\n\\n### 1. Creating the `kafka-collector` Module\\n\\nFirst, we need to create a new module in the project for Kafka monitoring, named `kafka-collector`. Then, modify the `pom.xml` file in this module.\\n[model-create](/img/blog/model-create.png)\\n\\n**`pom.xml` Configuration**\\n\\n```xml\\n<?xml version=\\"1.0\\" encoding=\\"UTF-8\\"?>\\n<project xmlns=\\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\\"\\n         xmlns:xsi=\\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\\"\\n         xsi:schemaLocation=\\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\\">\\n  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\\n  <parent>\\n    <groupId>org.apache.hertzbeat</groupId>\\n    <artifactId>hertzbeat-collector</artifactId>\\n    <version>2.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\\n  </parent>\\n\\n  <artifactId>hertzbeat-collector-kafka</artifactId>\\n  <name>${project.artifactId}</name>\\n\\n  <properties>\\n    <maven.compiler.source>17</maven.compiler.source>\\n    <maven.compiler.target>17</maven.compiler.target>\\n    <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>\\n  </properties>\\n\\n  <dependencies>\\n    <dependency>\\n      <groupId>org.apache.hertzbeat</groupId>\\n      <artifactId>hertzbeat-collector-common</artifactId>\\n      <scope>provided</scope>\\n    </dependency>\\n    \x3c!-- kafka --\x3e\\n    <dependency>\\n      <groupId>org.apache.kafka</groupId>\\n      <artifactId>kafka-clients</artifactId>\\n    </dependency>\\n  </dependencies>\\n</project>\\n```\\n\\nPoints to note:\\n\\n- Set `artifactId` to `hertzbeat-collector-kafka` to maintain naming consistency.\\n- Manually add the dependencies required for Kafka in `dependencies`.\\n\\n### 2. Adding the Kafka Protocol Class\\n\\nTo enable the Collector module to handle the Kafka monitoring protocol, we need to create a `KafkaProtocol` class to define the connection parameters for Kafka. This class should be located at `common/src/main/java/org/apache/hertzbeat/common/entity/job/protocol/KafkaProtocol.java`.\\n\\n```java\\npackage org.apache.hertzbeat.common.entity.job.protocol;\\n\\nimport lombok.AllArgsConstructor;\\nimport lombok.Builder;\\nimport lombok.Data;\\nimport lombok.NoArgsConstructor;\\n\\n@Data\\n@Builder\\n@AllArgsConstructor\\n@NoArgsConstructor\\npublic class KafkaProtocol {\\n\\n  /**\\n   * IP address or domain name\\n   */\\n  private String host;\\n\\n  /**\\n   * Port number\\n   */\\n  private String port;\\n\\n  /**\\n   * Timeout\\n   */\\n  private String timeout;\\n\\n  /**\\n   * Command\\n   */\\n  private String command;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 3. Adding Kafka Support in Metrics\\n\\nIn the `common/src/main/java/org/apache/hertzbeat/common/entity/job/Metrics.java` class, add support for the Kafka protocol.\\n\\n```java\\nprivate KafkaProtocol kclient;\\n```\\n\\n### 4. Adding Constants\\n\\nDefine constants for the Kafka protocol in the `DispatchConstants` class.\\n\\n```java\\nString PROTOCOL_KAFKA = \\"kclient\\";\\n```\\n\\n### 5. Adding the Kafka Connection Class\\n\\nThe `KafkaConnect` class is used to manage the connection logic for the Kafka Admin.\\n\\n```java\\npackage org.apache.hertzbeat.collector.collect.kafka;\\n\\nimport org.apache.hertzbeat.collector.collect.common.cache.AbstractConnection;\\nimport org.apache.kafka.clients.admin.AdminClient;\\nimport org.apache.kafka.clients.admin.AdminClientConfig;\\nimport org.apache.kafka.clients.admin.KafkaAdminClient;\\n\\nimport java.util.Properties;\\n\\npublic class KafkaConnect extends AbstractConnection<AdminClient> {\\n\\n  private static AdminClient adminClient;\\n\\n  public KafkaConnect(String brokerList) {\\n    Properties properties = new Properties();\\n    properties.put(AdminClientConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, brokerList);\\n    properties.put(AdminClientConfig.RETRIES_CONFIG, 3);\\n    adminClient = KafkaAdminClient.create(properties);\\n  }\\n\\n  @Override\\n  public AdminClient getConnection() {\\n    return adminClient;\\n  }\\n\\n  @Override\\n  public void closeConnection() throws Exception {\\n    if (this.adminClient != null) {\\n      this.adminClient.close();\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  public static synchronized AdminClient getAdminClient(String brokerList) {\\n    if (adminClient == null) {\\n      Properties properties = new Properties();\\n      properties.put(AdminClientConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, brokerList);\\n      adminClient = KafkaAdminClient.create(properties);\\n    }\\n    return adminClient;\\n  }\\n\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 6. Implementing the Kafka Collection Class\\n\\nInherit from the `AbstractCollect` class and implement the specific data collection logic within it. Specific logic details are not covered here.\\n\\n```java\\n/*\\n * Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more\\n * contributor license agreements.

Configuring the SPI Service File\\n\\nIn the `collector/collector/src/main/resources/META-INF/services/org.apache.hertzbeat.collector.collect.AbstractCollect` file, add the `KafkaCollectImpl` class.\\n\\n```text\\n...\\norg.apache.hertzbeat.collector.collect.kafka.KafkaCollectImpl\\n```\\n\\n### 8. Adding Kafka Dependencies to the Collector Module\\n\\nThe final step is to add the `kafka-collector` module dependency in `collector/collector/pom.xml`:\\n\\n```xml\\n<dependency>\\n  <groupId>org.apache.hertzbeat</groupId>\\n  <artifactId>hertzbeat-collector-kafka</artifactId>\\n  <version>${hertzbeat.version}</version>\\n</dependency>\\n```\\n\\nBy following the above steps, we have completed the development of a Kafka Collector, from protocol definition to the final SPI configuration and dependency management, fully extending a Kafka monitoring module.\\n\\n## Adding Configuration Parsing Files\\n\\n```yaml\\n# Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more\\n# contributor license agreements.

Committer!","permalink":"/blog/2024/08/31/new-committer"}},"content":"## Self-Introduction\\n\\nHello everyone, I\'m Yuxuan Zhang, a graduate student from Beijing University of Technology. I am deeply honored to become a Committer for the Apache HertzBeat\u2122 project.\\n\\n## My Journey with Apache HertzBeat\\n\\nI came across the HertzBeat project through this year\'s [Open Source Promotion Plan](https://summer-ospp.ac.cn/) event. I was thrilled by the project\'s introduction, which mentioned \\"Agentless\\" and \\"Full web-based operation.\\" I thought to myself, could monitoring really be this simple? At the time, our lab had just set up a new server, which I used to monitor with this project.\\n\\nThe project also supports one-click deployment via Docker, making it incredibly easy to get started. The refreshing interface also caught my eye. After using it, I was deeply attracted by the project\'s simplicity, ease of use, and comprehensive monitoring features. Moreover, issues and PRs in the project were responded to quickly, which motivated me to get involved in the project\'s development.\\n\\nContributing to a project takes time, so the first step was to thoroughly understand it. I usually start with the project documentation. It so happened that there was an issue about improving the documentation, so I took it on. By referencing the user interface, examining the source code, and following the existing document format, I successfully submitted my first PR to the project.\\n\\nAs I dug deeper, I added [a monitoring template for OpenAI accounts via the HTTP protocol](https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/pull/1947). Later, I implemented [support for the IMAP protocol](https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/pull/2059) and features to [monitor systems directly via script commands on Windows and Linux](https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/pull/2313).\\n\\nDuring this time, I also submitted several minor fixes and feature PRs, such as [correctly displaying the monitoring status after creating, modifying, or restarting monitoring](https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/pull/2065) and [implementing cascading parameter lists on the front-end](https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/pull/1978).\\n\\n## Experience Sharing: University Students Participating in Open Source\\n\\nUniversity students can learn excellent coding styles and design patterns from projects while participating in real-world development.\\n\\nPassion is the best motivation. First, find a project you\'re interested in, whether it\'s for its functionality, interface, or something else.\\n\\nA good community environment is also crucial. This is usually reflected in having active contributors, detailed and comprehensive README and project documentation, and quick responses to issues and PRs.\\n\\nOnce you\'ve found a project that meets the above criteria, you can pull the project\'s code to your local machine, follow the documentation to deploy and run it. Start as a user, and during this process, you might notice minor issues or incomplete features, which naturally leads to filing issues and attempting to fix them, even if it\'s just correcting a typo or misspelling. The community will always welcome it. You can gradually dive deeper through the project documentation and contribute to the project.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nI\'m very happy to become a Committer for the community. This is an important milestone for me, and I will continue contributing to the Apache HertzBeat\u2122 community in the future. I also hope that Apache HertzBeat\u2122 will successfully graduate from the incubator and that the community will continue to grow.\\n\\nI want to extend my heartfelt thanks to [TJxiaobao](https://github.com/TJxiaobao) for guiding me in getting started with the project and for always supporting my contributions.

In my daily work, I not only focus on code quality and system performance but also actively participate in the design and optimization of technical solutions.\\n\\nBesides work, I am also passionate about the open-source community. Participating in open-source projects not only allows me to continuously learn new technologies and best practices but also helps me meet like-minded developers and jointly promote technological advancement. Becoming a Committer for Apache HertzBeat\u2122 is an important milestone in my open-source journey, and I will continue to strive to make more contributions to the project and community.\\n\\n## Participating in the Apache Community\\n\\nThe first Apache project I participated in was Apache ShenYu (<https://github.com/apache/shenyu>). As an API gateway project, ShenYu provided me with an opportunity to gain a deep understanding of microservice architecture and gateway technology. Through my involvement in ShenYu\'s development, I not only enhanced my technical skills but also learned about the collaboration methods and open-source spirit of the Apache community.\\n\\nThis experience gave me a deeper understanding of the Apache community and laid the foundation for my later participation in other Apache projects, such as HertzBeat. From ShenYu to HertzBeat, I gradually deepened my understanding and contribution to Apache projects, eventually becoming a Committer for HertzBeat.\\n\\n## Encountering HertzBeat and Starting to Contribute\\n\\nAfter participating in the Apache ShenYu project, I gained a deeper understanding of how open-source communities operate. At this time, I came across the Apache HertzBeat\u2122 project by chance, which aims to create an easy-to-use, high-performance open-source real-time monitoring and alerting system.\\n\\nHertzBeat\'s philosophy and functionality immediately caught my interest. As a backend development engineer, I deeply understand the importance of monitoring systems in modern software architecture. HertzBeat not only provides rich monitoring features but also focuses on user experience and scalability, which aligns very well with my technical philosophy.\\n\\nWith enthusiasm for the project, I began to delve into HertzBeat\'s codebase and documentation. I found many interesting challenges and areas for improvement in the project, which sparked my desire to contribute. After gradually familiarizing myself with the project structure and contribution process, I contributed my accumulated experience in monitoring various relational databases, NoSQL, and other middleware from my work to the project.\\n\\nAs my understanding of the project deepened, I began to try solving more complex problems, such as performance optimization and new feature development. Each contribution not only taught me new knowledge but also made me feel the power and warmth of the open-source community. The feedback and support from project maintainers and other contributors further convinced me that participating in HertzBeat was the right choice.\\n\\nThrough continuous contributions and interactions with community members, I gradually became an active member of the HertzBeat community. This experience not only improved my technical skills but also gave me a deep understanding of the open-source spirit and the importance of collaboration. It was these ongoing contributions and participation that ultimately led to my nomination as a Committer for HertzBeat.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nBecoming a Committer for Apache HertzBeat\u2122 is an important milestone in my open-source journey. I will continue to strive to make more contributions to the project and community, while also looking forward to growing and progressing together with more team members, jointly promoting the prosperity and development of the project."},{"id":"/2024/08/18/new-committer","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/08/18/new-committer","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/edit/master/home/blog/2024-08-18-new-committer.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-08-18-new-committer.md","title":"Becoming an Apache Committer is a recognition of my participation in open source","description":"My open source journey","date":"2024-08-18T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 18, 2024","tags":[{"label":"opensource","permalink":"/blog/tags/opensource"},{"label":"practice","permalink":"/blog/tags/practice"}],"readingTime":7.23,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"yuluo-yx","title":"Shown Ji","url":"https://github.com/yuluo-yx"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Becoming an Apache Committer is a recognition of my participation in open source","author":"yuluo-yx","author_title":"Shown Ji","author_url":"https://github.com/yuluo-yx","tags":["opensource","practice"],"keywords":["open source monitoring system","alerting system","Apache","Apache Committer","Hertzbeat"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Welcome to HertzBeat Community Committer!","permalink":"/blog/2024/08/31/new-committer"},"nextItem":{"title":"Welcome to HertzBeat Community Committer!","permalink":"/blog/2024/07/29/new-committer"}},"content":"## My open source journey\\n\\nSpeaking of open source, I came into contact with it at the beginning of my junior year. The scene at that time is still vivid in my mind.\\n\\nIn retrospect, my first official Github Pull Request was to remove a redundant Pom dependency for the Spring Cloud Alibaba project. I was very busy at the time, and after more than two hours of figuring it out, I finally submitted the first Pull Request successfully. I am very grateful to [Cheng Pu](https://github.com/steverao), who introduced me to open source and took the crucial first step in participating in open source.\\n\\nFrom the initial rush of using Git, to now `git c -m XXX`, as well as participating in various PR/Issue on Github. Looking back, I have so many thoughts. I think life is nothing more than this. Learn and explore -> use skillfully -> make achievements.\\n\\nFrom my junior year to the present, I still maintain my passion for open source and participate in open source. To this day, I am already a committer on three projects.\\n\\n## Participate in the Apache Community\\n\\n[Apache Software Foundation (ASF)](https://community.apache.org/) is an American non-profit organization that aims to support various open source software projects. ASF was originally formed by a group of developers of Apache HTTP Server and was officially established on March 25, 1999. As of 2021, its total membership is approximately 1,000. The name comes from a local Indian tribe in North America.  \\nThis tribe is famous for its superb military literacy and superhuman endurance. In the second half of the 19th century, it resisted the invaders who invaded their territory. In order to show respect for this Indian tribe, the name of the tribe (Apache) is used as the server name.  \\nBut when it comes to this naming, there is an interesting story circulating here. Because this server is based on the NCSA HTTPd server and is the product of continuous revision and patching through the efforts of everyone, it is nicknamed \\"A Patchy Server\\" (a patch server). Here, because \\"A Patchy\\" and \\"Apache\\" are homophones, it was finally officially named \\"Apache Server\\".\\n\\nThe above is an introduction to the Apache Software Foundation from Wikipedia.\\n\\nThe Apache Software Foundation was originally composed of developers who developed [Apache HTTPd](https://httpd.apache.org/). Starting from the Apache HTTPd web server project, they created many excellent open source projects, attracting Common open source enthusiasts around the world participate in the maintenance and iteration of the project. Projects continue to be retired, and new projects are constantly being hatched, over and over again. Only then did the Apache Software Foundation become what it is today.\\n\\n![Apache HTTPd Server Logo](/img/blog/committer/yuluo-yx/4.jpg)\\n\\n### First contribution\\n\\nThe first contribution in the Apache community should be to delete a `{@link}` code link to the Dubbo project. I\'m ashamed to say that [Dubbo](https://github.com/apache/dubbo) is the first open source project I participated in Apache, and there are only 6 submissions so far. In May, I came into contact with the [Apache Hertzbeat](https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat) project through [Rick](https://github.com/LinuxSuRen), and started my Apache contribution from unit testing. road.\\n\\n### Get nominated and become a Committer\\n\\nThis nomination was recommended by PPMC Member [Logic](https://github.com/zqr10159) of Apache HertzbeatP(Incubating). Thanks to the Apache HertzBeat\u2122 Team. I was successfully nominated to become a Hertzbeat Committer and got my own Apache mailbox.\\n\\n![Apache ID Email](/img/blog/committer/yuluo-yx/3.jpg)\\n\\n### The meaning of Apache Committer\\n\\nAs the saying goes, the greater the ability, the greater the task. Becoming a project committer is not only a change of identity, but also an recognition and affirmation of one\'s own abilities. When reviewing the PR, my \u2018LGTM\u2019 is no longer a gray style, but has become blue (due to different personal Github themes, the execution color is also different). No need to wait for other Committer Approve CIs. It means that you have management rights over the project.\\n\\n![PR approval](/img/blog/committer/yuluo-yx/5.jpg)\\n\\n## How to participate in open source\\n\\nAnyone who wants to do something needs an opportunity and a guide. Among the many Apache projects, there are many people who pay attention to the project\'s Issue List. The one time that remains fresh in my memory is: one night after writing the unit test of a tool class, I discovered a small bug. What I thought at the time was that there was too much contextual information and it was not good to write it in a PR, so I opened an Issue to record the context.  \\nHow small is this bug? It was so small that I just created the Issue. After submitting the unit test and the code to fix the bug together, I refreshed the PR List again and saw a PR Title to fix the bug.\\n\\nIn fact, there is no shortage of people paying attention to the project, but more of an opportunity! Opportunities to participate in projects.\\n\\n### The Apache Way\\n\\n[The Apache Way](https://www.apache.org/theapacheway/) pursued by the Apache Community. The community is greater than the code. A good community is often more important than excellent code. The components of the community include developers, users, etc. Users are the first users of the project code. A healthy community status is when users discover problems, then report problems, and finally solve problems during use.  \\nA more likely scenario is that a user reports a problem, switches from being a user to a developer, and solves the problem. And continue to participate in the maintenance of community projects.\\n\\n### Paths to participate in open source\\n\\nOpen source is often pure, and the Apache Foundation exists to protect projects and developers.\\n\\n#### Apache Community Identity\\n\\nBefore contributing to the community, it is important to understand the community\'s definition of identity, where a project\'s Committers are located, and how to become a Committer. The Apache community has a clear definition of [Contributor Identity](<https://community.apache.org/contributor-ladder>. html): [Contributor Identity](<https://community.apache.org/contributor-ladder>. html). The Apache community has a very clear definition of [contributor status](. html):\\n\\n! [Apache contributor label](/img/blog/committer/yuluo-yx/6.jpg)\\n\\n#### Project Committer Nomination Criteria\\n\\nThe conditions for a Project PPMC Team to nominate a Committer are different. Take Apache HertzBeat\u2122 for example:\\n\\n! [Apache HertzBeat\u2122 becoming committer](/img/blog/committer/yuluo-yx/7.jpg)\\n\\nEach project has its own standards, and these standards are not set in stone and will be adjusted at each stage of the project.\\n\\n#### How to Participate in Open Source\\n\\nNext is the highlight of this section, how to participate in open source and get nominated as a Committer?\\n\\n##### Open Source Events\\n\\nStudents, because of their special status, do not have the experience of developing large-scale projects and do not have the opportunity to cut their teeth in a production environment. Therefore, it is often difficult to get involved in open source and there is a lack of opportunities.\\n\\nI think the best way to get involved in open source and get nominated is the **Open Source Summer (OSPP) or Google Summer of Open Source (GSOC) events**. After completing the topic in question, gradual familiarization with the project\'s features, code, and continued participation will result in a nomination. There is also no lack of students who are nominated to become project Committer directly after completing the topic.\\n\\nThe next step is to **Improve your Coding ability**, find the missing unit tests and code bugs in the project, and then submit PR to fix them. This is often difficult for students who are just starting out, and the Coding ability is often built up after optimizing the project code and understanding every change.\\n\\nThe ecosystem around a good project**is often crucial**. A good documentation allows users/developers to quickly get started and participate in contributing. Multi-language extensions allow the project to be used in projects built in other languages, expanding the project\'s audience. A good Example repository allows users to discover more ways to use the project. Therefore, participating in the construction of the Example repository and writing and translating documentation is one of the ways to familiarize yourself with the project and get nominated.\\n\\nFinally, I would like to say that getting nominated is something that just happens. You should not participate in open source just for the sake of getting nominated, and you should never forget your original intention.\\n\\nProject communities tend to welcome contributions in all ways: be it code, documentation or sermons.\\n\\n## Random Thoughts\\n\\nI\'m writing this post to commemorate the special occasion of becoming an Apache HertzBeat\u2122 Committer, and to motivate me to get involved in open source in the future.\\nKeep up the enthusiasm, keep up the coding, and thank you for all the people who have helped me while I\'ve been involved in open source. I wish Hertzbeat the best of luck in its incubation and graduation to become a top Apache project! \ud83c\udf89"},{"id":"/2024/07/29/new-committer","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/07/29/new-committer","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/edit/master/home/blog/2024-07-29-new-committer.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-07-29-new-committer.md","title":"Welcome to HertzBeat Community Committer!","description":"HertzBeat","date":"2024-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 29, 2024","tags":[{"label":"opensource","permalink":"/blog/tags/opensource"},{"label":"practice","permalink":"/blog/tags/practice"}],"readingTime":2.805,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"kerwin612","title":"Le Zhang","url":"https://github.com/kerwin612"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Welcome to HertzBeat Community Committer!","author":"kerwin612","author_title":"Le Zhang","author_url":"https://github.com/kerwin612","tags":["opensource","practice"],"keywords":["open source monitoring system","alerting system"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Becoming an Apache Committer is a recognition of my participation in open source","permalink":"/blog/2024/08/18/new-committer"},"nextItem":{"title":"Welcome to HertzBeat Community Committer!","permalink":"/blog/2024/07/28/new-committer"}},"content":"![HertzBeat](/img/blog/new-committer.png)\\n\\n> It\'s an honor for me to become a Committer of Apache HertzBeat\\n\\n## Becoming Part of a Stronger Team: My Contributions and Growth\\n\\nIn the open-source community, every contribution not only pushes the project forward but also signifies personal growth. Recently, in the Apache HertzBeat\u2122 project, I have contributed through a series of optimizations and feature enhancements, which have not only advanced the project but also improved my skills. Today, I would like to share my contribution experience and insights into my growth.\\n\\n## Starting from the Details: Optimizing Visuals and Interactions\\n\\nI firmly believe that details determine success or failure. When I first joined the project, I began by optimizing the interface to enhance the user\'s visual and interactive experience. I refined the modal window layout of the monitoring selection menu to better align with user operation habits.  \\nI adjusted the header style and content layout of the monitoring details page to make information presentation clearer and more intuitive. Additionally, I unified the border-radius values of components and addressed issues such as missing internationalization translations, ensuring the consistency and completeness of the system interface.\\n\\nThese seemingly minor changes significantly enhanced the overall aesthetics and user experience of the system. Through this process, I gained a profound understanding of the importance of interface design for user experience and honed my attention to detail.\\n\\n## Delving into Functional Modules for Enhanced Capabilities\\n\\nIn addition to interface optimization, I actively engaged in expanding and enhancing the functional modules of the system. I refactored repetitive code within the system, abstracted common components, and improved code reusability and maintainability. These improvements not only simplified the development process but also reduced the cost of maintenance in the long run. Furthermore, I extended the capabilities of the multi-functional input component by adding support for password types and search types, further enriching its functionality and versatility.\\n\\nDuring the process of implementing these features, I encountered numerous challenges. However, these challenges spurred me to continuously learn and explore new technologies and methodologies. By consulting official documentation and other resources, I gradually overcame these obstacles and successfully completed the tasks. This process not only enhanced my technical abilities but also deepened my understanding of the importance of team collaboration.\\n\\n## Emphasizing User Feedback for Continuous Product Optimization\\n\\nI firmly believe that users are the ultimate judges of a product. As such, I continuously collect and analyze user feedback both within the company and in the community, using these insights to guide targeted optimizations and improvements. By refining search and filtering functionalities and adopting a consistent and concise set of interactive elements, I have consistently enhanced the user experience.\\n\\nIn this process, I realized the importance of a user-centric approach. Only by genuinely focusing on users\' needs and expectations can we create products that meet market demands.\\n\\n## Looking Ahead: Continuous Contribution and Growth\\n\\nReflecting on my past contributions, I feel a profound sense of pride and satisfaction. However, I am also acutely aware of the many areas where I still have room for improvement and need to continue learning and growing. Moving forward, I will uphold the spirit of rigor, innovation, and user-centricity, continuously exploring and practicing to contribute even more to the Apache HertzBeat\u2122 project. I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to grow and progress alongside my fellow team members, jointly driving the project towards prosperity and success."},{"id":"/2024/07/28/new-committer","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/07/28/new-committer","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/edit/master/home/blog/2024-07-28-new-committer.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-07-28-new-committer.md","title":"Welcome to HertzBeat Community Committer!","description":"HertzBeat","date":"2024-07-28T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 28, 2024","tags":[{"label":"opensource","permalink":"/blog/tags/opensource"},{"label":"practice","permalink":"/blog/tags/practice"}],"readingTime":1.78,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"linDong","title":"linDong","url":"https://github.com/Yanshuming1"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Welcome to HertzBeat Community Committer!","author":"linDong","author_title":"linDong","author_url":"https://github.com/Yanshuming1","tags":["opensource","practice"],"keywords":["open source monitoring system","alerting system"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Welcome to HertzBeat Community Committer!","permalink":"/blog/2024/07/29/new-committer"},"nextItem":{"title":"Welcome to HertzBeat Community Committer!","permalink":"/blog/2024/07/27/new-committer"}},"content":"![HertzBeat](/img/blog/new-committer.png)\\n\\n> It\'s an honor for me to become a Committer of Apache Hertzbeat\\n>\\n## Personal introduction\\n\\nI graduated in 2023 and am currently working as a Java developer in an Internet company.\\n\\n## First met Apache Hertzbeat\\n\\nAfter graduation and working for half a year, I had the idea of getting involved in open source. However, when searching for open source projects on GitHub, I found that many communities were not very active, and the official documentation was not complete, making it quite difficult to start with the projects. Therefore, I put the matter of open source on hold for the time being.\\n\\nOne day, I saw a post by Senior Xiaobao on a certain platform and was immediately intrigued. I then privately messaged Xiaobao to consult about open source matters. Senior Xiaobao was extremely enthusiastic and meticulous in explaining many aspects of open source to me and recommended the Hertzbeat project.\\n\\n## My first PR\\n\\nI downloaded the source code of Hertzbeat and compiled and tested it according to the documentation. Then, when clicking on the functions on the page, I discovered a bug in the front-end pop-up window. So, I submitted my first issue and successfully claimed this issue, thus starting my first PR.\\n\\n## Keep active in community\\n\\nAfter submitting the first PR, I continuously followed the issues in the Hertzbeat community and attempted to solve the existing problems. I have successively completed tasks such as specifying @people on WeChat, integrating AI, adding a PrestoDB monitor, modifying bugs, and contributing to the official website documentation.\\n\\n## Reward\\n\\nAfter several months of contributing to open source, I have reaped a lot. I have learned the business logic in the code, code norms, some technical frameworks that I have never used before, and some algorithms. It can be said that I have benefited greatly.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nBecoming a Committer of Apache HertzBeat\u2122 is a very meaningful thing for me. In the future, I will continue to contribute to the Apache HertzBeat\u2122 community.

One day a thought came to my mind, which is to contribute to open-source community. Then I met Hertzbeat in an article on the internel, which is completely different from Prometheus and Skywalking that I had known before. Hertzbeat fascinate me with its feature, agentless and anyone can custom monitoring by monifying yaml. I forked Hertzbeat on GitHub and tried to run it locally for further study.\\n\\n## My first PR\\n\\nI failed to start Hertzbeat when I followed instructions in CONTRIBUTING.

Let me introduce myself briefly. I have been working as a backend developer since 2019, mainly using Java. Currently, I am working at a network security company, focusing on the backend development of network security-related products.\\n\\n### Encounter\\n\\nIn my work, several physical servers are deployed, running various databases and middleware. Although we have deployed the Prometheus + Grafana monitoring combination, most services and servers require additional installation of exporters.  \\nAs a result, this monitoring system does not cover the entire project. Sometimes, we only realize a service is down when it is too late. One day in April, I came across an article introducing HertzBeat. I was immediately attracted by its unique features, such as no need for agents and fully visualized configuration, along with support for one-click deployment via Docker. I quickly deployed HertzBeat and put it into use.\\n\\n### Familiarization\\n\\nDue to the fully visualized operation, I quickly incorporated the servers, databases, and middleware used in the project into HertzBeat\'s management. Afterwards, the community was preparing to release the first Apache version and needed to supplement a large amount of documentation. I attempted to submit some documents to familiarize myself with the community\'s process for submitting code and documentation, and at the same time, I got familiar with the relevant parts of the code while supplementing the documents.\\n\\n### Trying to Add Something\\n\\nThe first major change I made was to enable HertzBeat to support querying metrics from NebulaGraph using NGQL statements. Additionally, I added a monitoring template for NebulaGraph clusters based on this protocol. The idea initially came from my own needs. When I submitted this idea to the community, I quickly received a response and affirmation from the community, which greatly increased my confidence in continuously participating in this project.\\n\\n### Joining\\n\\nDue to my continuous writing of documents and contributing code, I started to become familiar with this community and this project, and began to make some of my own suggestions. Many of these suggestions were adopted by the community and released in new versions.

At that time, I was looking for an open source project to monitor our company\'s related services. As a general monitoring project, Apache HertzBeat\u2122 naturally came into my sight. I began to understand its architecture and functions by reading official documents and browsing the project\'s code base.\\n\\n### Start contributing\\n\\nAfter having a preliminary understanding of the project, I found that it needed to complete the monitoring scope of the big data field, so I decided to start contributing some code. I started with supplementing big data monitoring. This not only helped me understand the project more deeply, but also gradually let other members of the community know me.  \\nI remember that the first Pull Request I submitted was to add a new Hbase cluster monitoring template. Although it seems insignificant, I was very excited when it was merged. This was a real interaction between me and the open source community and my first step towards greater contribution.\\n\\n### In-depth participation\\n\\nAs my understanding of the project deepened, I began to challenge some more complex problems. I read a lot of code, participated in daily discussions in the community, monthly meeting discussions, and actively spoke in issue/pr. These activities not only helped me improve my technical skills, but also gave me a better grasp of the direction of the project. I began to put forward my own ideas and suggestions, actively participated in design discussions, and proposed some new features.\\n\\n### Nominated as Committer\\n\\nAfter a period of active contribution, I received a nomination from the community (tom) Committer. Becoming a Committer means that I will have greater responsibilities and authority. The nomination process is open and transparent, and every member of the community has the opportunity to express their opinions.\\n\\n### Experience after becoming a Committer\\n\\nAfter becoming a Committer, my role has changed. Not only did I continue to contribute code, I also began to be responsible for reviewing other contributors\' code, helping them solve problems, and guiding their contributions. This process has taught me a lot and made me more deeply realize the importance of community collaboration.\\n\\nAs a Committer, I need to find a balance between code quality and project development. I learned how to conduct code reviews effectively, how to provide constructive feedback, and how to deal with conflicts. These experiences have not only improved my technical skills, but also made me make great progress in communication and collaboration.\\n\\n### Mental journey\\n\\nLooking back on the whole process, from the initial wait-and-see attitude to active participation, and then to becoming a Committer, I have experienced a lot of challenges and growth. Sometimes I feel confused because of technical difficulties, and sometimes I feel lost because my contribution is not accepted. But it is these challenges that make me constantly reflect and improve, and constantly improve my abilities.\\n\\nIn this process, I also received help and support from many people. The predecessors in the community gave me a lot of guidance and advice, and their selfless sharing benefited me a lot. I also met many like-minded friends. We participated in open source together, discussed problems together, solved problems together, and celebrated success together.\\n\\n### Personal feelings\\n\\nBecoming a Committer of Apache HertzBeat\u2122 is an important milestone in my career. This is not only a recognition of my technical ability, but also an affirmation of my contribution to the open source community. Becoming a Committer is not an end, but a new beginning. I still have a lot to learn and improve.\\n\\nThis process made me understand the importance of cooperation and made me feel the charm of the open source spirit. Open source is not only a way to share technology, but also a concept of collaboration and common progress. I am very honored to be a member of the Apache HertzBeat\u2122 community and hope to continue to contribute to the development of the project in the future.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nBecoming a Committer of the Apache HertzBeat\u2122 project is a challenging and rewarding journey. Through continuous learning and contribution, I have not only improved my technical ability, but also found a sense of belonging and accomplishment in the community.  \\nI hope that my experience can inspire more people to participate in the open source community and jointly promote the progress and development of technology. To borrow the words of Tom: Participating in open source should not affect everyone\'s work and life, otherwise it will go against the original intention. Everyone should participate in the free time after get off work."},{"id":"/2024/07/07/new-committer","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/07/07/new-committer","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/edit/master/home/blog/2024-07-07-new-committer.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-07-07-new-committer.md","title":"Welcome to HertzBeat Community Committer!","description":"HertzBeat","date":"2024-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 7, 2024","tags":[{"label":"opensource","permalink":"/blog/tags/opensource"},{"label":"practice","permalink":"/blog/tags/practice"}],"readingTime":2.025,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"crossoverJie","title":"crossoverJie","url":"https://github.com/crossoverjie"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Welcome to HertzBeat Community Committer!","author":"crossoverJie","author_title":"crossoverJie","author_url":"https://github.com/crossoverjie","tags":["opensource","practice"],"keywords":["open source monitoring system","alerting system"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Welcome to HertzBeat Community Committer!","permalink":"/blog/2024/07/08/new-committer"},"nextItem":{"title":"HertzBeat First Apache version v1.6.0 released now!","permalink":"/blog/2024/06/15/hertzbeat-v1.6.0"}},"content":"![HertzBeat](/img/blog/new-committer.png)\\n\\n> \ud83c\udf89 I am very pleased to become a Committer for the Apache HertzBeat\u2122 project, and I have been invited by the community to introduce myself \ud83e\udd70.\\n\\nI have been working in backend development since I started my career in 2015, engaging in business development, infrastructure, and technical management. Currently, I am working as an infrastructure engineer at an internet company.\\n\\nI have always been passionate about the open-source community, and I am also a Committer for Apache Pulsar and a Contributor for OpenTelemetry and VictoriaMetrics.\\n\\n## My Connection with HertzBeat\\n\\nIn April of this year, when HertzBeat entered the Apache Incubator, I happened to see a recommendation on a WeChat public account in my social circle.\\n\\nMy first reaction was that the name was really well chosen \ud83d\ude04. Then, after looking closely at the features it provides and the problems it solves, I realized its powerful functionalities \ud83d\udcaa.\\n\\nSince I also need to maintain an observability system at my company, and I have participated in an open-source project called cprobe (which has some similar goals to HertzBeat), I have some experience with monitoring systems and a strong interest in them. Therefore, I read the documentation and quickly started it locally (the community has done a great job in this regard, as many open-source projects lose potential developers right at the initial startup step).\\n\\n## Starting Contributions\\n\\nMy first PR was to fix an incorrect path in a PR template, and the community responded very quickly, which gave me a very positive impression.\\n\\nSo I started reading some of the core collection code of HertzBeat and found that many logics did not have unit tests at the time. Thus, I began to fill in these tests.\\n\\n> Starting with unit tests is indeed a good way to get familiar with a new project.\\n\\nWhile supplementing the unit tests, I also discovered some code logic optimizations and code formatting inconsistencies, which I addressed and reported to the community.\\n\\nSimilarly, the community\'s response was swift \ud83c\udfce, which greatly encouraged my enthusiasm.\\n\\nDuring this process, I also incorporated some excellent experiences from other communities (Pulsar, OpenTelemetry) into HertzBeat. Everyone learned from each other, which is undoubtedly the charm of open source.\\n\\nLastly, I want to thank the community\'s logicz for inviting me to become a Committer and tom for reviewing my PRs. I wish HertzBeat a successful graduation from the incubator and becoming a star project \ud83c\udf8a."},{"id":"/2024/06/15/hertzbeat-v1.6.0","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/06/15/hertzbeat-v1.6.0","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/edit/master/home/blog/2024-06-15-hertzbeat-v1.6.0.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-06-15-hertzbeat-v1.6.0.md","title":"HertzBeat First Apache version v1.6.0 released now!","description":"Hi guys, We are excited to announce that Apache HertzBeat\u2122 has released its first Apache version v1.6.0! \ud83c\udf89.","date":"2024-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 15, 2024","tags":[{"label":"opensource","permalink":"/blog/tags/opensource"},{"label":"practice","permalink":"/blog/tags/practice"}],"readingTime":19.535,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"tom","title":"tom","url":"https://github.com/tomsun28"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"HertzBeat First Apache version v1.6.0 released now!","author":"tom","author_title":"tom","author_url":"https://github.com/tomsun28","tags":["opensource","practice"],"keywords":["open source","monitoring","alerting"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Welcome to HertzBeat Community Committer!","permalink":"/blog/2024/07/07/new-committer"},"nextItem":{"title":"HertzBeat 1.6.0 Upgrade Guide","permalink":"/blog/2024/06/11/hertzbeat-v1.6.0-update"}},"content":"**Hi guys, We are excited to announce that Apache HertzBeat\u2122 has released its first Apache version v1.6.0! \ud83c\udf89.**\\n\\nThrough nearly five months of community development iteration and two months of Apache Incubator incubation process, Apache HertzBeat\u2122 v1.6.0 is finally out.  \\nIn this version, we added monitoring for OpenAi, Redfish protocol servers, plugin mechanism, and support for NebulaGraph, Apache Yarn, HDFS, Hbase, Storm, and more functional features.  \\nDue to license compatibility issues, we replaced multiple dependencies at the bottom layer, Hibernate -> EclipseLink, which is also a rare migration pitfall practice in the JPA ecosystem.  \\nAt the same time, some bugs were fixed and some functions were optimized, and more complete documents.

introduction","permalink":"/blog/2024/05/09/hertzbeat-ospp-subject-introduction"}},"content":"**Note: This guide is applicable for upgrading from 1.5.0 to 1.6.0 to version 1.6.0.**\\n**If you are using an older version, it is recommended to reinstall using the export function, or upgrade to 1.5.0 and then follow this guide to 1.6.0.**\\n\\n## Binary Installation Package Upgrade\\n\\n### Upgrade Java Environment\\n\\nSince version 1.6.0 uses Java 17 and the installation package no longer provides a built-in JDK version, use the new Hertzbeat according to the following situations:\\n\\n- When the default environment variable on your server is Java 17, you do not need to take any action for this step.\\n- When the default environment variable on your server is not Java 17, such as Java 8 or Java 11, and if there are no other applications on your server that require a lower version of Java, download the appropriate version from [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) according to your system, and search the engine for how to set a new environment variable pointing to the new Java 17.\\n- When the default environment variable on your server is not Java 17, such as Java 8 or Java 11, and if there are other applications on your server that require a lower version of Java, download the appropriate version from [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) according to your system, and rename the extracted folder to `java`, then copy it to the Hertzbeat extraction directory.\\n\\n### Upgrade Database\\n\\nGo to [https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/tree/master/hertzbeat-manager/src/main/resources/db/migration](https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/tree/master/hertzbeat-manager/src/main/resources/db/migration), choose the directory of your database and execute the corresponding `V160__update_column.sql` file for the upgrade SQL.\\n\\n### Upgrade Configuration Files\\n\\nDue to significant changes in `application.yml` and `sureness.yml`, it is recommended to directly use the new `yml` configuration files and then modify them based on your own needs.\\n\\n#### `application.yml` generally needs to modify the following parts\\n\\nDefault is:\\n\\n```yaml\\n  datasource:\\n    driver-class-name: org.h2.Driver\\n    username: sa\\n    password: 123456\\n    url: jdbc:h2:./data/hertzbeat;MODE=MYSQL\\n    hikari:\\n      max-lifetime: 120000\\n\\n  jpa:\\n    show-sql: false\\n    database-platform: org.eclipse.persistence.platform.database.MySQLPlatform\\n    database: h2\\n    properties:\\n      eclipselink:\\n        logging:\\n          level: SEVERE\\n```\\n\\nIf you change to a MySQL database, here is an example:\\n\\n```yaml\\n  datasource:\\n    driver-class-name: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver\\n    username: root\\n    password: root\\n    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/hertzbeat?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=utf-8&useSSL=false&serverTimezone=Asia/Shanghai\\n    hikari:\\n      max-lifetime: 120000\\n\\n  jpa:\\n    show-sql: false\\n    database-platform: org.eclipse.persistence.platform.database.MySQLPlatform\\n    database: mysql\\n    properties:\\n      eclipselink:\\n        logging:\\n          level: SEVERE\\n```\\n\\n#### `sureness.yml` modification is optional, usually when you need to change account passwords\\n\\n```yaml\\n# account info config\\n# eg: admin has role [admin,user], password is hertzbeat\\n# eg: tom has role [user], password is hertzbeat\\n# eg: lili has role [guest], plain password is lili, salt is 123, salted password is 1A676730B0C7F54654B0E09184448289\\naccount:\\n  - appId: admin\\n    credential: hertzbeat\\n    role: [admin]\\n  - appId: tom\\n    credential: hertzbeat\\n    role: [user]\\n  - appId: guest\\n    credential: hertzbeat\\n    role: [guest]\\n  - appId: lili\\n    # credential = MD5(password + salt)\\n    # plain password: hertzbeat\\n    # attention: digest authentication does not support salted encrypted password accounts\\n    credential: 94C6B34E7A199A9F9D4E1F208093B489\\n    salt: 123\\n    role: [user]\\n```\\n\\n### Add the corresponding database drivers\\n\\nDue to the Apache Foundation\'s requirements for license compliance,

[hertzBeat](/img/blog/new-committer.png)\\n\\n> Welcome to HertzBeat\'s three new community committeers, let\'s learn more about their open source experience!\\n\\n## New Committer - leo\\n\\n**Name: Leo**\\n\\n**Github ID: leo-934**\\n\\n### Getting to know Hertzbeat for the first time\\n\\nIn March 2023, I noticed Hertzbeat\'s project, so I directly sent an email to Tom in the community to ask if I could join, and he replied very quickly. It just so happened that I was in my senior year of college when I had more time, so I decisively picked an issue to resolve and had my first pull request at Hertzbeat.\\n\\n### Start submitting PR\\n\\nIn the following period, I spent some time reading Hertzbeat\'s code, and submitted a few PRs off and on until April, when I learned about the Summer of Open Source event, and it just so happened that Hertzbeat was participating as well, so I submitted my application information and was selected. My task is mainly responsible for the implementation of a push collector, in the process of writing the code, I got a lot of community mentor Zheng Chenxin and Tom to help, and finally was able to successfully complete the code, the whole process is still relatively smooth.\\n\\n### Open source contributions\\n\\n- Add push module to expose interface for users to push data.\\n- Implement the collection of push data in the collector module.\\n- Implement user-defined data display in the front-end.\\n\\n### Harvest\\n\\n- Exposed to a great open source community and improved my skills in related areas.\\n\\nThanks to Tom and my ospp mentor, Zheng Chenxin, who gave me a lot of help and advice during my exposure to the open source community. Currently I am still in charge of some of the code development in the community, I hope Hertzbeat can be better and better in the future!\\n\\n---\\n\\n## New Committer - SongXiao\\n\\n**Name: Zhou Shusheng**\\n\\n**Junior student at Henan Normal University**\\n\\n### Getting to know Hertzbeat for the first time\\n\\nIn March this year, under the influence of Xiaobao\'s seniors, I had some concepts about open source projects and laid the foundation for learning open source projects later, but I didn\'t go further because I only learned some Java basics at that time.\\n\\n### Start submitting PR\\n\\nIn July this year, after basically completing the study of Java framework development, with the encouragement of Xiaobao, I started to try to pull issues, and submitted my first PR on July 20, during this period, I also consulted with the author of Hertzbeat and Dongfeng for some related issues, thank you very much.\\n\\n### Open source contributions\\n\\n- Support for Spring Gateway, Apache Spark, Apache Hive and other services metrics collection\\n- Customize nginx and pop3 protocols to collect metrics for Nginx and POP3 mailbox servers, and add corresponding help files.\\n\\n### Harvest\\n\\n- Exposed to better and more complex large-scale projects, improved programming and problem-solving skills.\\n- Put the theoretical knowledge into practice, gained JUC, microservice related development experience, and valuable project experience.\\n\\n### Thanks to our community partners\\n\\nThanks to the author of HertzBeat, HertzBeat/Sms4j Committer Tiejia Xiaobao, Sms4j Committer Dongfeng, when I encountered problems that I could not solve, I often asked the three brothers to ask for advice, and they are always tired of patiently helping me solve the problem, there are really no words.\\n\\nThanks to the other partners in the community, I\'ve gained a lot from communicating and discussing with them, and I\'ve also felt the active open source atmosphere in the community.\\n\\n### Some advice for newcomers\\n\\n- When you first get involved in an open source project, start with simple tasks. Gradually familiarize yourself with the code and process of the project, and gradually take on more complex tasks.\\n- If you encounter problems that you can\'t solve by yourself, you can ask for help from the community.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## New Committer - Dongfeng\\n\\n**Name: Zhang Yang\\n\\n**Freshman from Henan Normal University**\\n\\n### Getting to know hertzbeat for the first time\\n\\nIn June of this year, I started to learn more about the project, I was recommended by a friend to learn about the project, I have been exploring open source projects and communities, and I like the atmosphere of sharing, discussing and improving each other. At the same time, I also tried to implement some monitoring in my previous projects, so I am more interested in this project.\\n\\n### Start submitting PR\\n\\nSince July this year, I found hertzbeat\'s issues and prs are very active, so I went through their issues and prs to find out how to implement monitoring for a certain protocol. Then I found out that there is a task about smtp protocol monitoring, so I discussed with the author on the issue, and then I finished my pr through documentation and code.\\n\\n### Open source contributions\\n\\n- Implementation of smtp, ntp, websocket availability monitoring.\\n- Implement monitoring metrics for memcached and NebulaGraph.\\n- Add documentation for the implemented monitoring.\\n\\n### Harvest\\n\\n- Gained monitoring-related development experience and added a valuable project experience.\\n- Gained a deeper understanding of network protocols.\\n- I gained a deeper understanding of network protocols. I gained a preliminary understanding of the contribution process of open source projects.\\n\\n### Thank you to our community partners\\n\\nThanks to the authors of hertzbeat for the documentation and help. Thanks to my friends for providing me with the courage to try to enter the open source project to contribute. Thanks to other community members for their issues and prs, which accelerated my understanding of the project.\\n\\n### A bit of advice for newcomers\\n\\n- Issues and pr\'s are the knock on the door of the project you are getting to know, so be willing to discuss and express your opinion.\\n- No matter how big or small your contribution is, be willing to try and keep improving yourself.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### What is HertzBeat?\\n\\n[HertzBeat HertzBeat](https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat) is an open source real-time monitoring and alerting system with powerful customizable monitoring capabilities, high performance clustering, Prometheus compatibility, and no Agent required.\\n\\n#### Features\\n\\n- Integrate **Monitoring+Alerting+Notification** into one system, support monitoring thresholds and alerting notifications for application services, applications, databases, caches, operating systems, big data, middleware, web servers, cloud-native, networks, customization, etc. in one step.\\n- Easy to use and friendly, no need for `Agent`, full `WEB` page operation, a little mouse click to monitor alarms, zero start-up learning costs.\\n- Configurable `Http, Jmx, Ssh, Snmp, Jdbc, Prometheus` protocol specification, just configure the monitoring template `YML` in your browser to customize the metrics you want to collect using these protocols. Do you believe that you can instantly adapt to a new type of monitoring such as `K8s` or `Docker` just by configuring it?\\n- Compatible with `Prometheus` system ecosystem and more, you can monitor what `Prometheus` can monitor with a single page action.\\n- High-performance, supports horizontal scaling of multiple collector clusters, multi-isolated network monitoring, and cloud-side collaboration.\\n- Free alarm threshold rules, `Email` `Discord` `Slack` `Telegram` `Nail` `WeChat` `Flybook` `SMS` `Webhook` `Server sauce` and other methods of timely delivery of messages.\\n\\n> ``HertzBeat``s powerful customization, multi-type support, high performance, easy to extend, low coupling, hope to help developers and teams quickly build their own monitoring system.\\n\\n**Github: <https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat>**\\n\\n**Gitee: <https://gitee.com/hertzbeat/hertzbeat>**\\n\\nWelcome more partners to participate in HertzBeat\'s open source collaboration, no matter a typo or punctuation we are very welcome, we learn together to make progress, the goal is to do a world-class open source software."},{"id":"/2023/12/11/hertzbeat-v1.4.3","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/12/11/hertzbeat-v1.4.3","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/edit/master/home/blog/2023-12-11-hertzbeat-v1.4.3.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-12-11-hertzbeat-v1.4.3.md","title":"HertzBeat v1.4.3 released, prometheus-compatible!","description":"What is HertzBeat?","date":"2023-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 11, 2023","tags":[{"label":"opensource","permalink":"/blog/tags/opensource"},{"label":"practice","permalink":"/blog/tags/practice"}],"readingTime":5.54,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"tom","title":"tom","url":"https://github.com/tomsun28"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"HertzBeat v1.4.3 released, prometheus-compatible!","author":"tom","author_title":"tom","author_url":"https://github.com/tomsun28","tags":["opensource","practice"],"keywords":["open source monitoring system","alerting system"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Welcome to HertzBeat Community Committer!","permalink":"/blog/2024/01/11/new-committer"},"nextItem":{"title":"HertzBeat v1.4.2 released, custom notice template!","permalink":"/blog/2023/11/12/hertzbeat-v1.4.2"}},"content":"### What is HertzBeat?\\n\\n[HertzBeat](https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat) is an open source, real-time monitoring system with custom monitoring, high performance cluster, prometheus-compatible and agentless capabilities.\\n\\n### Features\\n\\n* Combines **monitoring, alarm, and notification** features into one platform, and supports monitoring for web service, program, database, cache, os, webserver, middleware, bigdata, cloud-native, network, custom and more.\\n* Easy to use and agentless, web-based and with one-click monitoring and alerting, zero learning curve.\\n* Makes protocols such as `Http, Jmx, Ssh, Snmp, Jdbc, Prometheus` configurable, allowing you to collect any metrics by simply configuring the template `YML` file online.

The component code is modular but does not support the independent deployment of the collector. The upper limit of the number of monitoring supported is naturally limited by a single node, and it cannot cope with the unified management of resources in multiple isolated networks.\\nAfter more than a month of iterations, we rewrote the collection task scheduling, deployed the collectors independently, and designed the stand-alone version and the cluster version to use the same set of codes to facilitate subsequent maintenance and upgrades. The two modes of the stand-alone cluster can be switched without perception. In the end, I am very happy that the cluster version met with you as scheduled.\\n\\nThe cluster version not only brings us more powerful monitoring performance, but also has functions such as cloud-side collaboration that are full of imagination.\\n\\n#### High performance cluster\\n\\n* Supports the deployment of collector clusters, multi-collector clusters scale horizontally, and exponentially improves the number of monitors and collection performance.\\n* The monitoring task is self-scheduled in the collector cluster. A single collector hangs up and migrates the collection task without perceptual failure. Newly added collector nodes are automatically scheduled to share the collection pressure.\\n* It is very convenient to switch between stand-alone mode and cluster mode and deploy without additional components.\\n\\n![HertzBeat](/img/docs/cluster-arch.png)\\n\\n#### Cloud Edge Collaboration\\n\\n> Support the deployment of edge collector clusters, and cooperate with the main HertzBeat service cloud to improve collection capabilities.\\n\\nIn the isolated network where multiple networks are not connected, in the previous solution, we needed to deploy a monitoring system on each network, which resulted in the incompatibility of data and inconvenient management, deployment and maintenance.\\nHertzBeat provides cloud-edge collaboration capabilities. Edge collectors can be deployed on multiple isolated networks. When monitoring is added, collectors are specified. The collectors collect monitoring tasks within the isolated network, and report the collected data. The main HertzBeat service performs unified scheduling, management and display.\\nThis is mostly used in unified monitoring scenarios of multiple isolated data centers or cloud resources and resources under the cloud of different vendors.\\n\\n![HertzBeat](/img/docs/cluster-arch.png)\\n\\n### Why open source cluster version?\\n\\nOften, some strategies for making open source products that need to be commercialized will be to use the stand-alone version as a toy for the beginners of small players, and then use the cluster version as a closed-source product for paid players who need it. This model can be said to be very good and worthy of recognition, that is, to ensure that open source can also get benefits, and it is also applicable to the development strategy of many open source projects, and it may be more smooth on the business path.\\nSome people on the Internet will sneer at such open source projects that are divided into stand-alone and cluster versions, thinking that they are pseudo-open source, and open source is a gimmick. They think that open source should be open source and free, and the open source team should contribute everything selflessly. . . . Very speechless people like this, there is only return for investment. When you use open source software for free and get value, should you think about what you have paid for open source software instead of just asking for it.\\nSo back to the topic, why do we want an open source cluster version? Just because you love open source? If you say that we are still teenagers, you may believe this, but do you believe this when a person who is going to be 30 and has family responsibilities says this, I don\u2019t believe it myself\ud83d\ude02.\\nFirst of all, let\'s take a look at what open source can bring, or why open source should be done. The idea of full-time open source at the beginning is very simple, to make your favorite open source product (realized), the programmer\'s dream can be deployed on thousands of servers (see the downloads have been realized), and then make money based on this open source product ( not crying yet).\\n\\n* User traffic. Open source projects are provided free of charge to users and developers, and have advantages in attracting users to use and promoting them.\\n* User trust. Open source products are naturally easy to gain the trust and patience of users, or lower the threshold of trust for users.\\n* Community collaboration. Open source products can attract top contributors to contribute together, receive user feedback issues, pr contributions, etc.\\n* Driven by the community, open source projects will become better and better, and more people will participate and use them after positive feedback. Community collaboration I think this is the meaning of open source, and this is not just the contribution code collaboration between programmers, users are all collaboration objects (for example, our project has a large number of operation and maintenance friends who contribute code and documents), if it is only code Open source without community collaboration, it is better to release an installation package for others to use and download for free.\\n* Product ecology. This is required for some ecological products, such as hertzbeat, which need to support monitoring types that connect to various types of protocols, and a large number of monitoring templates. Only a good open source project ecology can attract other contributors to contribute and share, exchange what is needed in the ecology, and ultimately everyone will benefit from the ecology. This is difficult to do in closed source programs.\\n\\nThe above points focus on community collaboration and product ecology. This is also the reason for the open source cluster version. Only open source products can be rolled into stronger product power. For example, the technical feature of cluster will naturally attract developers (and the cluster itself is The product of our community collaboration) will attract more users and contributors to use feedback and iterate together. The community drives and then positively promotes open source projects and satisfies user functional experience.\\nAs for open source commercialization, the premise of open source commercialization is to have a really good, popular, and widely used open source product, and then do commercialization on this basis to make money.\\n\\n### Install quickly via docker\\n\\n1.

Major release. HertzBeat v1.3.2 has published.\\n\\n**This delightful version came out of the hard work of 27 friends. Thank them! Love \ud83d\udc97**\\n\\nIn this version, we support new monitoring types and metrics for **freebsd, debian, opensuse, redhat, apache doris**, etc.\\n\\n- Support WEB page configuration mail server, replace the previous file configuration\\n- Supports alarm convergence. If repeated alarms are frequently sent, it will be resolved immediately with alarm convergence\\n- The public message queue supports Kafka. In addition to our default built-in memory message queue, it also supports an external Kafka message queue to improve system performance.\\n- The new monitoring center page aggregates all monitoring types, no need to switch back and forth like before.\\n- Support label group display, group and mark monitors of the same business category for unified management.\\n- Threshold configuration not only has expressions, but also supports a more user-friendly operation UI. The previous expressions were not friendly to newcomers and were prone to errors. Now you can directly operate the UI, and it can switch between expressions.\\n- There are many more functions such as HTTP ipv6.\\n\\nFixed a large number of BUG, improved the document code, and improved the overall stability and usability.

Docker installation of GreptimeDB\\n\\n    ```shell\\n    $ docker run -p 4000-4004:4000-4004 \\\\\\n        -p 4242:4242 -v \\"$(pwd)/greptimedb:/tmp/greptimedb\\" \\\\\\n        --name greptime \\\\\\n        greptime/greptimedb:0.2.0 standalone start \\\\\\n        --http-addr 0.0.0.0.0:4000 \\\\\\n        --rpc-addr 0.0.0.0:4001\\n    ```\\n\\n   - `-v \\"$(pwd)/greptimedb:/tmp/greptimedb\\"` is the local persistent mount for the greptimeDB data directory, it is recommended to replace `$(pwd)/greptimedb` with the actual local directory you want to specify for storage.\\n\\n2. Use ``$ docker ps | grep greptime`` to see if GreptimeDB started successfully.\\n\\n#### Installing and Deploying HertzBeat\\n\\nSee the [official documentation](https://hertzbeat.apache.org/zh-cn/docs/start/docker-deploy) for details.\\n\\n1. Docker installs HertzBeat.\\n\\n    ```shell\\n    $ docker run -d -p 1157:1157 \\\\\\n        -e LANG=zh_CN.UTF-8 \\\\\\n        -e TZ=Asia/Shanghai \\\\\\n        -v /opt/data:/opt/hertzbeat/data \\\\\\n        -v /opt/application.yml:/opt/hertzbeat/config/application.yml \\\\\\n        --restart=always \\\\\\n        --name hertzbeat apache/hertzbeat\\n    ```\\n\\n   - `-v /opt/data:/opt/hertzbeat/data` : (Optional, data persistence) Important \u26a0\ufe0f Mount the H2 database files to the local host to ensure that the data will not be lost due to the creation and deletion of the container\\n\\n   - `-v /opt/application.yml:/opt/hertzbeat/config/application.yml` : Mount customized local configuration files to the container, i.e. use local configuration files to overwrite the container configuration files.\\n\\n    Note that the \u26a0\ufe0f local mount configuration file `application.yml` needs to exist in advance, and the full contents of the file can be found in the project repository [/script/application.yml](<https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/raw/master/script/> application.yml)\\n\\n2. Go to <http://ip:1157/> with the default account and password admin/hertzbeat to see if HertzBeat starts successfully.\\n\\n#### Configure to use GreptimeDB to store HertzBeat monitoring metrics metrics data\\n\\n1. Modify the HertzBeat configuration file.\\n\\n    Modify the locally mounted HertzBeat configuration file [application.yml](https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/raw/master/script/application.yml), in package mode modify `hertzbeat/ config/application.yml\\n\\n    **Modify the `warehouse.store.jpa.enabled` parameter in there to `false`, configure the `warehouse.store.greptime` datasource parameter in there, the URL account password, and enable `enabled` to `true`**.\\n\\n    ```yaml\\n    warehouse:\\n      store:\\n        jpa:\\n          enabled: false\\n        greptime:\\n          enabled: true\\n          endpoint: localhost:4001\\n    ```\\n\\n2. Restart HertzBeat.\\n\\n    ```shell\\n    docker restart hertzbeat\\n    ```\\n\\n#### Observe the authentication effect\\n\\n1. visit HertzBeat in your browser <http://ip:1157/> default account password admin/hertzbeat\\n2. Use HertzBeat to add application monitors, such as website monitors, Linux monitors, Mysql monitors, and so on.\\n3. After monitoring and collecting several cycles, check whether GreptimeDB database stores the metrics data and whether HertzBeat metrics data graph data is displayed normally.\\n\\nHere\'s the picture: !\\n\\n![HertzBeat](/img/blog/greptime-1.png)\\n\\n![HertzBeat](/img/blog/greptime-2.png)\\n\\n![HertzBeat](/img/blog/greptime-3.png)\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nThis article took us to experience how to use the open source time-series database GreptimeDB to store the metrics data of the open source real-time monitoring HertzBeat, in general, the two open source products is very simple to get started, the key is that if it is too much trouble do not want to deploy both of them still have cloud services \ud83d\ude02 let you toss.\\nAs one of the developers of the feature [HertzBeat supports GreptimeDB](https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/pull/834), in the actual adaptation process, GreptimeDB\'s silky-smooth native SDK and relational database-like SQL, let us from other GreptimeDB native SDK and relational database-like SQL make it very easy to switch from other time-series databases like `TDengine, IotDB, InfluxDB` to GreptimeDB, and the experience is very smooth.\\n\\nGreptimeDB Github: <https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb>\\nHertzBeat Github: <https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat>\\n\\n**Finally, you are welcome to be more understanding, more use, more comments, more ISSUE, more PR, more Star support these two did not come out for a long time hope to get care of open source cattle are not afraid of difficulties a small star oh!

The `actuator` metric endpoint is exposed on the SpringBoot2 application side, which will provide metrics endpoints data\\n\\n1. Open SpringBoot Actuator Endpoint to expose `metrics health env` metric interface\\n\\n    ```yaml\\n    management:\\n       endpoints:\\n         web:\\n           exposure:\\n             include:\\n               - \'metrics\'\\n               - \'health\'\\n               - \'env\'\\n         enabled-by-default: on\\n    ```\\n\\n2. After restarting, test whether the access metric interface `ip:port/actuator` has response json data as follows:\\n\\n    ```json\\n    {\\n       \\"_links\\": {\\n         \\"self\\": {\\n           \\"href\\": \\"http://localhost:1157/actuator\\",\\n           \\"templated\\": false\\n         },\\n         \\"health-path\\": {\\n           \\"href\\": \\"http://localhost:1157/actuator/health/{*path}\\",\\n           \\"templated\\": true\\n         },\\n         \\"health\\": {\\n           \\"href\\": \\"http://localhost:1157/actuator/health\\",\\n           \\"templated\\": false\\n         },\\n         \\"env\\": {\\n           \\"href\\": \\"http://localhost:1157/actuator/env\\",\\n           \\"templated\\": false\\n         },\\n         \\"env-toMatch\\": {\\n           \\"href\\": \\"http://localhost:1157/actuator/env/{toMatch}\\",\\n           \\"templated\\": true\\n         },\\n         \\"metrics-requiredMetricName\\": {\\n           \\"href\\": \\"http://localhost:1157/actuator/metrics/{requiredMetricName}\\",\\n           \\"templated\\": true\\n         },\\n         \\"metrics\\": {\\n           \\"href\\": \\"http://localhost:1157/actuator/metrics\\",\\n           \\"templated\\": false\\n         }\\n       }\\n    }\\n    ```\\n\\n#### Add SpringBoot2 application monitoring in the HertzBeat monitoring ui\\n\\n1. Click to add SpringBoot2 monitoring\\n\\n    Path: Menu -> Application Service Monitoring -> SpringBoot2 -> Add SpringBoot2 Monitoring\\n\\n    ![HertzBeat](/img/blog/monitor-springboot2-1.png)\\n\\n2. Configure the parameters required for new monitoring SpringBoot2\\n\\n    Fill in the SpringBoot2 application **peer IP**, **service port** (default 8080), **account password, etc.** on the monitoring page, and finally click OK to add.\\n    For other parameters such as **collection interval**, **timeout period**, etc., please refer to the help document <https://hertzbeat.apache.org/docs/help/>\\n\\n    ![HertzBeat](/img/blog/monitor-springboot2-2.png)\\n\\n3. Complete \u2705, now we have added the monitoring of the SpringBoot2 application, check the monitoring list to see our additions.\\n\\n    ![HertzBeat](/img/blog/monitor-springboot2-3.png)\\n\\n4. Click **Operation**->**Monitoring Details Icon** of the monitoring list item to browse the real-time monitoring metric data of the SpringBoot2 application.\\n\\n    ![HertzBeat](/img/blog/monitor-springboot2-4.png)\\n\\n5. Click **Monitoring History Details TAB** to browse the historical monitoring metric data chart of the SpringBoot2 application\ud83d\udcc8.\\n\\n    ![HertzBeat](/img/blog/monitor-springboot2-5.png)\\n\\n**DONE! Done! It doesn\'t require us to deploy agents or various cumbersome operations, isn\'t it very simple**\\n\\n- **Just one step to configure the IP port on the HertzBeat monitoring page and add SpringBoot2 application monitoring**\\n\\n:::tip\\nThrough the above, we have completed the monitoring of the SpringBoot2 application. We can check the status and availability of various metrics of the SpringBoot2 application at any time in HertzBeat.  \\nOf course, it is impossible to manually check the metrics in real time. Monitoring is often accompanied by alarm thresholds. When the performance metrics of the SpringBoot2 application exceed our threshold or the SpringBoot2 application itself is abnormal, we can promptly notify our corresponding person in charge. The person in charge receives the notification and handles it. , this is a complete monitoring and alarm process.\\n:::\\n\\n**Next, we will demonstrate step by step how to configure the threshold alarm notification in the HertzBeat system. When the metrics of the SpringBoot2 application are abnormal, we will be notified in time**\\n\\n#### 3. Add SpringBoot2 application metric threshold alarm in HertzBeat system\\n\\n1. Configure an alarm threshold for an important metric\\n\\n    Path: Menu -> Threshold Rules -> Add Threshold\\n\\n   - Select the configured metric object. SpringBoot2 application monitoring mainly focuses on stack memory threads and other related metrics. For example, we set the threshold for the metric `threads` -> `threads`. When the number of threads in the `runnable` state is greater than At 300 an alert is issued.\\n   - Here we configure to send an alarm when `size`, `state` of `equals(state, \\"runnable\\"\\") && size>300` of this metric, the alarm level is **warning alarm**, which will be triggered three times, specifically As shown below.\\n\\n    ![HertzBeat](/img/blog/monitor-springboot2-6.png)\\n\\n    ![HertzBeat](/img/blog/monitor-springboot2-7.png)\\n\\n2. Add message notification recipients\\n\\n    > Configure the receiver to let the alarm message know who to send and how to send it.\\n\\n    Path: Menu -> Alarm Notification -> Alarm Recipient -> Add New Recipient\\n\\n    Message notification methods support **email, DingTalk, WeChat Work, Feishu, WebHook, SMS**, etc. Here we take the commonly used DingTalk as an example.\\n\\n    - Refer to this [Help Documentation](https://hertzbeat.apache.org/docs/help/alert_dingtalk) <https://hertzbeat.apache.org/docs/help/alert_dingtalk> to configure the robot on DingTalk and set the security custom keyword `HertzBeat`, get the corresponding `access_token` value.\\n    - Configure the receiver parameters in HertzBeat as follows.\\n\\n    \u3010Alarm Notification\u3011->\u3010New Recipient\u3011->\u3010Select DingTalk Robot Notification Method\u3011->\u3010Set DingTalk Robot ACCESS_TOKEN\u3011->\u3010OK\u3011\\n\\n    ![HertzBeat](/img/blog/alert-notice-1.png)\\n\\n3. Configure the associated alarm notification strategy \u26a0\ufe0f [Add notification strategy] -> [Associate the recipient just set] -> [OK]\\n\\n    > Configure the alarm notification policy to bind the alarm message with the receiver, so that you can decide which alarms to send to whom.\\n\\n    ![HertzBeat](/img/blog/alert-notice-2.png)\\n\\n### Finished, now wait for the warning message to come. ding ding ding ding\\n\\n```text\\n[HertzBeat warning notification]\\nAlarm target object: springboot2.threads.size\\nAffiliated monitoring ID: 483783444839322\\nBelonging monitoring name: SPRINGBOOT2_localhost\\nAlarm level: warning alarm\\nAlarm trigger time: 2023-03-22 21:13:44\\nContent details: The springboot2 service\'s runnable state threads num is over 300, now is 444.\\n```\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\n:::tip\\nThis practical article took us to experience how to use the open source real-time monitoring tool HertzBeat to monitor SpringBoot2 application metric data. We can find that HertzBeat, which integrates `monitoring-alarm-notification`, is more convenient in operation and use, just click a little on the page The SpringBoot2 application can be included in the monitoring and alarm notification, and the tedious operations of deploying multiple components and writing configuration files are no longer needed.\\n:::\\n\\n> Only one docker command is needed to install and experience heartbeat:\\n\\n`docker run -d -p 1157:1157 --name hertzbeat apache/hertzbeat`\\n\\n## More powerful\\n\\n> Through the simple steps above, we have realized the monitoring of SpringBoot2, but the built-in metrics in it do not meet the needs. Can we customize and monitor more metrics of SpringBoot2? The answer is of course yes, through **Monitoring Definition**->**SpringBoot2** on the page, you can customize and modify the performance metrics you want to monitor by editing the following YML configuration file at any time.\\n\\n![HertzBeat](/img/blog/monitor-springboot2-8.png)\\n\\n## What is HertzBeat?\\n\\n> [HertzBeat](https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat) is an open source, real-time monitoring tool with custom-monitor and agentless.\\n> **Monitor+Alerter+Notify** all in one.

Configure an alarm threshold for an important metric.\\n\\n    Path: Menu -> Alert Thresholds -> Add Thresholds\\n\\n   - DynamicTp monitors some thread pool related metrics, for example, we set the threshold for the `run_timeout_count` `thread_pool_running` -> `run_timeout_count` metric, which will raise an alarm when the thread_timeout_count is greater than one.\\n   - Here we configure an alert to be issued when `thread_pool_running` has a `run_timeout_count>1`, with an alert level of **Serious Alert**, which is triggered three times, as shown in the following figure.\\n\\n    ![HertzBeat](/img/blog/monitor-dynamic-tp-6.png)\\n\\n2. Add message notification recipients\\n\\n    > Configure recipients to let alert message know who to send to and in what way.\\n\\n    Path: Menu -> Alert Notification -> Alert Recipient -> Add Recipient.\\n\\n    Message notification methods support **Email, Dingtalk, WeChat, Flybook, WebHook, SMS**, etc. We take the commonly used Dingtalk as an example.\\n\\n   - Refer to this [help document](https://hertzbeat.apache.org/docs/help/alert_dingtalk) <https://hertzbeat.apache.org/docs/help/alert_dingtalk> Configure the bot on Dingtalk side, set the security customization keyword `HertzBeat`, get the corresponding `access_token` value.\\n   - Configure the recipient parameters in HertzBeat as follows.\\n\\n    [Alert Notification] -> [Add Recipient] -> [Choose Dingtalk bot notification method] -> [Set Dingtalk bot ACCESS_TOKEN] -> [OK]\\n\\n    ![HertzBeat](/img/blog/alert-notice-1.png)\\n\\n3. Configure the associated alert notification policy \u26a0\ufe0f [Add Notification Policy] -> [Associate the recipient you just set] -> [OK] !\\n\\n    > Configure the alert notification policy to bind alert messages to recipients so that you can decide which alerts go to which person.\\n\\n    ![HertzBeat](/img/blog/alert-notice-2.png)\\n\\n### Over and out, now wait for the alert message to come through.
