At the time, I was still just following online tutorials and books to learn the source code of some well-known open-source frameworks.\nWith a mindset of learning, I attempted to run HertzBeat locally. However, I soon encountered an issue where the project wouldn't start. Because of this, I submitted my first PR\u2014modifying the startup documentation.\nThis PR was swiftly merged into the master branch, which greatly encouraged me. From then on, I began to delve deeper into HertzBeat. It was challenging at first, and I didn't know where to start.\nAs I gained a deeper understanding of it, I gradually began to dissect its modules and code structure. During this period, I claimed numerous tasks and bugs from the community's issue list and submitted corresponding PRs.\nFrom documentation, unit testing, frontend, backend, to new feature development, I unknowingly gained extensive knowledge within this project.
