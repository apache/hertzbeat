[hertzBeat](/img/blog/new-committer.png)\\n\\n> Welcome to Dromara HertzBeat\'s three new community committeers, let\'s learn more about their open source experience!\\n\\n# New Committer - vinci\\n\\n**Name: Wang Jianing**\\n\\n**First year graduate student, School of Computer Science, Zhejiang University**\\n\\n**Github ID: vinci-897**\\n\\n## Getting to know Hertzbeat for the first time\\n\\nIn March 2023, I noticed Hertzbeat\'s project, so I directly sent an email to Tom in the community to ask if I could join, and he replied very quickly. It just so happened that I was in my senior year of college when I had more time, so I decisively picked an issue to resolve and had my first pull request at Hertzbeat.\\n\\n## Start submitting PR\\n\\nIn the following period, I spent some time reading Hertzbeat\'s code, and submitted a few PRs off and on until April, when I learned about the Summer of Open Source event, and it just so happened that Hertzbeat was participating as well, so I submitted my application information and was selected. My task is mainly responsible for the implementation of a push collector, in the process of writing the code, I got a lot of community mentor Zheng Chenxin and Tom to help, and finally was able to successfully complete the code, the whole process is still relatively smooth.\\n\\n## Open source contributions\\n\\n- Add push module to expose interface for users to push data.\\n- Implement the collection of push data in the collector module.\\n- Implement user-defined data display in the front-end.\\n\\n## Harvest\\n\\n- Exposed to a great open source community and improved my skills in related areas.\\n\\n\\nThanks to Tom and my ospp mentor, Zheng Chenxin, who gave me a lot of help and advice during my exposure to the open source community. Currently I am still in charge of some of the code development in the community, I hope Hertzbeat can be better and better in the future!\\n\\n\\n\\n----\\n\\n# New Committer - SongXiao\\n\\n\\n\\n**Name: Zhou Shusheng**\\n\\n**Junior student at Henan Normal University**\\n\\n## Getting to know Hertzbeat for the first time\\n\\nIn March this year, under the influence of Xiaobao\'s seniors, I had some concepts about open source projects and laid the foundation for learning open source projects later, but I didn\'t go further because I only learned some Java basics at that time.\\n\\n## Start submitting PR\\n\\nIn July this year, after basically completing the study of Java framework development, with the encouragement of Xiaobao, I started to try to pull issues, and submitted my first PR on July 20, during this period, I also consulted with the author of Hertzbeat and Dongfeng for some related issues, thank you very much.\\n\\n## Open source contributions\\n\\n* Support for Spring Gateway, Apache Spark, Apache Hive and other services metrics collection\\n* Customize nginx and pop3 protocols to collect metrics for Nginx and POP3 mailbox servers, and add corresponding help files.\\n\\n\\n## Harvest\\n\\n* Exposed to better and more complex large-scale projects, improved programming and problem-solving skills.\\n* Put the theoretical knowledge into practice, gained JUC, microservice related development experience, and valuable project experience.\\n\\n\\n## Thanks to our community partners\\n\\nThanks to the author of HertzBeat, HertzBeat/Sms4j Committer Tiejia Xiaobao, Sms4j Committer Dongfeng, when I encountered problems that I could not solve, I often asked the three brothers to ask for advice, and they are always tired of patiently helping me solve the problem, there are really no words.\\n\\nThanks to the other partners in the community, I\'ve gained a lot from communicating and discussing with them, and I\'ve also felt the active open source atmosphere in the Dromara community.\\n\\n## Some advice for newcomers\\n\\n* When you first get involved in an open source project, start with simple tasks. Gradually familiarize yourself with the code and process of the project, and gradually take on more complex tasks.\\n* If you encounter problems that you can\'t solve by yourself, you can ask for help from the community.\\n\\n\\n\\n----\\n\\n# New Committer - Dongfeng\\n\\n\\n\\n**Name: Zhang Yang\\n\\n**Freshman from Henan Normal University**\\n\\n## Getting to know hertzbeat for the first time\\n\\nIn June of this year, I started to learn more about the project, I was recommended by a friend to learn about the project, I have been exploring open source projects and communities, and I like the atmosphere of sharing, discussing and improving each other. At the same time, I also tried to implement some monitoring in my previous projects, so I am more interested in this project.\\n\\n## Start submitting PR\\n\\nSince July this year, I found hertzbeat\'s issues and prs are very active, so I went through their issues and prs to find out how to implement monitoring for a certain protocol. Then I found out that there is a task about smtp protocol monitoring, so I discussed with the author on the issue, and then I finished my pr through documentation and code.\\n\\n## Open source contributions\\n\\n- Implementation of smtp, ntp, websocket availability monitoring.\\n- Implement monitoring metrics for memcached and NebulaGraph.\\n- Add documentation for the implemented monitoring.\\n\\n## Harvest\\n\\n- Gained monitoring-related development experience and added a valuable project experience.\\n- Gained a deeper understanding of network protocols.\\n- I gained a deeper understanding of network protocols. I gained a preliminary understanding of the contribution process of open source projects.\\n\\n## Thank you to our community partners.\\n\\nThanks to the authors of hertzbeat for the documentation and help. Thanks to my friends for providing me with the courage to try to enter the open source project to contribute. Thanks to other community members for their issues and prs, which accelerated my understanding of the project.\\n\\n## A bit of advice for newcomers\\n\\n- Issues and pr\'s are the knock on the door of the project you are getting to know, so be willing to discuss and express your opinion.\\n- No matter how big or small your contribution is, be willing to try and keep improving yourself.\\n\\n\\n----\\n\\n## What is HertzBeat?\\n\\n[HertzBeat HertzBeat](https://github.com/dromara/hertzbeat) is an open source real-time monitoring and alerting system with powerful customizable monitoring capabilities, high performance clustering, Prometheus compatibility, and no Agent required.\\n\\n### Features\\n\\n- Integrate **Monitoring+Alerting+Notification** into one system, support monitoring thresholds and alerting notifications for application services, applications, databases, caches, operating systems, big data, middleware, web servers, cloud-native, networks, customization, etc. in one step.\\n- Easy to use and friendly, no need for `Agent`, full `WEB` page operation, a little mouse click to monitor alarms, zero start-up learning costs.\\n- Configurable `Http, Jmx, Ssh, Snmp, Jdbc, Prometheus` protocol specification, just configure the monitoring template `YML` in your browser to customize the metrics you want to collect using these protocols.

[hertzBeat](/img/blog/new-committer.png)\\n\\nIt\'s great to welcome a new community `Committer`, unlike other contributors `logicz` comes from an Ops implementation position at Cyberoam rather than a development position, but the quality of the contributions, both in terms of code and documentation etc. is very high \ud83d\udc4d. This is also our `HertzBeat` and other open source projects are not the same place, because the user group is more oriented to the operation and maintenance of the development, in our 139 contributors in the operation and maintenance engineers accounted for more than 30%, which breaks the open source project collaboration and contribution to the object are the inherent cognition of the development position, which shows that whether it is the operation and maintenance engineers and test engineers to contribute to the open source project participation is very enthusiastic! This shows that both operation and maintenance engineers and test engineers are very enthusiastic about contributing to open source projects, not just as bystanders to open source collaboration. Participation in open source projects is not exclusive to a certain group of people, but is open to all who want to participate, it may be a document, a script or a piece of code, imagine your participation in the open source project is deployed to thousands of servers to run running, to help others to be used or browse the Review discussion, git record will always be kept, this may be the significance of participation in open source projects.\\n\\n> Welcome Dromara HertzBeat\'s newest community committer logicz, let\'s learn more about his open source experience!\\n\\n## logicz\\n\\nNickname: logicz\\n\\nName\uff1aQingraZhao\\n\\nWork\uff1aiFLYTEK technical support & operation and maintenance\\n\\nHertzbeat Committer\\n\\ngithub:zqr10159\\n\\n## Getting to know Hertzbeat\\n\\nIn March 2023, I started to contact Hertzbeat, due to the need for a complete monitoring->alerting platform for the project, due to the deployment of the project on the intranet, the company\'s internal closed-source monitoring platform can not be developed to meet the needs of cross-network segment alerts. Later in the github looking for open source monitoring platform, found Hertzbeat, easy to deploy and full-featured. The most important thing is that the author tom replies to issues and updates very quickly, very much in line with my imagination of the open source community, I\'m very happy to be able to participate in open source and can see their own results for everyone to use.\\n\\n## Ongoing open source contributions and gains\\n\\nSo far, to participate in the Hertzbeat open source project has been more than five months, from the first time to submit issues to the first time to submit pr, are the process of growth and progress, full count or a lot of pr, specific as follows:\\n\\n** contribution **:\\n\\n* Realize real-time data deposited into Redis custom db\\n\\n* New historical data deposited into GreptimeDB\\n\\n* provide monitoring batch import, export to xlsx and yml file function\\n\\n* Provide Web page custom mail server settings\\n\\n* Provide Apache doris FE,BE monitoring template.\\n\\n* Implement Server Chan (Server Chan) alarm push notification.\\n\\n* Access to third-party alarms (Tencent Cloud) to realize unified push notification of third-party alarms and Hertzbeat alarms.\\n\\n* Fix bugs such as not including collector information when importing and exporting monitoring.\\n\\n* Several document updates\\n\\n* * Harvesting **:\\n\\n* Hertzbeat is really an excellent project, in terms of project deployment, scripts and configuration are very standardized, I write a lot of my own projects have to draw on\\n\\n* The most important thing is to harvest the spirit of open source, we are in a community to communicate together, progress\\n\\n## Thanks to the community partners\\n\\nThanks to the author tom\'s guidance, he is really very good, patient and diligent, often in the middle of the night to change the bugs, thanks to him step by step to take me to the open source road (and also sent me two open source community T-shirts ^\\\\_^)\\n\\n## A little advice for newcomers\\n\\n* open source is not easy, to be able to stick with it, and share their results with everyone is a great sense of achievement\\n* Adopt good code habits, code can be written poorly, comments must be written clearly, so that other people can read and modify your code.\\n\\n## What is HertzBeat?\\n\\nHertzBeat HertzBeat is an open source real-time monitoring and alerting system with powerful customizable monitoring capabilities, high-performance clustering, and no Agent required.\\n\\n### Features\\n\\n* HertzBeat is an open source real-time monitoring and alerting system with powerful customizable monitoring capabilities, high performance clustering, and no agent required.\\n* Easy to use and friendly, no need for `Agent`, full `WEB` page operation, a little mouse click to monitor and alerts, zero hands-on learning costs.\\n* Configurable protocols such as `Http, Jmx, Ssh, Snmp, Jdbc`, etc. Just configure the monitoring template `YML` in your browser to customize the metrics you want to collect using these protocols.

The component code is modular but does not support the independent deployment of the collector. The upper limit of the number of monitoring supported is naturally limited by a single node, and it cannot cope with the unified management of resources in multiple isolated networks.\\nAfter more than a month of iterations, we rewrote the collection task scheduling, deployed the collectors independently, and designed the stand-alone version and the cluster version to use the same set of codes to facilitate subsequent maintenance and upgrades. The two modes of the stand-alone cluster can be switched without perception. In the end, I am very happy that the cluster version met with you as scheduled.\\n\\nThe cluster version not only brings us more powerful monitoring performance, but also has functions such as cloud-side collaboration that are full of imagination.\\n\\n#### High performance cluster\\n\\n- Supports the deployment of collector clusters, multi-collector clusters scale horizontally, and exponentially improves the number of monitors and collection performance.\\n- The monitoring task is self-scheduled in the collector cluster. A single collector hangs up and migrates the collection task without perceptual failure. Newly added collector nodes are automatically scheduled to share the collection pressure.\\n- It is very convenient to switch between stand-alone mode and cluster mode and deploy without additional components.\\n\\n![hertzbeat](/img/docs/cluster-arch.png)\\n\\n#### Cloud Edge Collaboration\\n\\n> Support the deployment of edge collector clusters, and cooperate with the main HertzBeat service cloud to improve collection capabilities.\\n\\nIn the isolated network where multiple networks are not connected, in the previous solution, we needed to deploy a monitoring system on each network, which resulted in the incompatibility of data and inconvenient management, deployment and maintenance.\\nHertzBeat provides cloud-edge collaboration capabilities. Edge collectors can be deployed on multiple isolated networks. When monitoring is added, collectors are specified. The collectors collect monitoring tasks within the isolated network, and report the collected data. The main HertzBeat service performs unified scheduling, management and display.\\nThis is mostly used in unified monitoring scenarios of multiple isolated data centers or cloud resources and resources under the cloud of different vendors.\\n\\n![hertzbeat](/img/docs/cluster-arch.png)\\n\\n### Why open source cluster version?\\n\\nOften, some strategies for making open source products that need to be commercialized will be to use the stand-alone version as a toy for the beginners of small players, and then use the cluster version as a closed-source product for paid players who need it. This model can be said to be very good and worthy of recognition, that is, to ensure that open source can also get benefits, and it is also applicable to the development strategy of many open source projects, and it may be more smooth on the business path.\\nSome people on the Internet will sneer at such open source projects that are divided into stand-alone and cluster versions, thinking that they are pseudo-open source, and open source is a gimmick. They think that open source should be open source and free, and the open source team should contribute everything selflessly. . . . Very speechless people like this, there is only return for investment. When you use open source software for free and get value, should you think about what you have paid for open source software instead of just asking for it.\\nSo back to the topic, why do we want an open source cluster version? Just because you love open source? If you say that we are still teenagers, you may believe this, but do you believe this when a person who is going to be 30 and has family responsibilities says this, I don\u2019t believe it myself\ud83d\ude02.\\nFirst of all, let\'s take a look at what open source can bring, or why open source should be done. The idea of full-time open source at the beginning is very simple, to make your favorite open source product (realized), the programmer\'s dream can be deployed on thousands of servers (see the downloads have been realized), and then make money based on this open source product ( not crying yet).\\n\\n- User traffic. Open source projects are provided free of charge to users and developers, and have advantages in attracting users to use and promoting them.\\n- User trust. Open source products are naturally easy to gain the trust and patience of users, or lower the threshold of trust for users.\\n- Community collaboration. Open source products can attract top contributors to contribute together, receive user feedback issues, pr contributions, etc. Driven by the community, open source projects will become better and better, and more people will participate and use them after positive feedback. Community collaboration I think this is the meaning of open source, and this is not just the contribution code collaboration between programmers, users are all collaboration objects (for example, our project has a large number of operation and maintenance friends who contribute code and documents), if it is only code Open source without community collaboration, it is better to release an installation package for others to use and download for free.\\n- Product ecology. This is required for some ecological products, such as hertzbeat, which need to support monitoring types that connect to various types of protocols, and a large number of monitoring templates. Only a good open source project ecology can attract other contributors to contribute and share, exchange what is needed in the ecology, and ultimately everyone will benefit from the ecology. This is difficult to do in closed source programs.\\n\\nThe above points focus on community collaboration and product ecology. This is also the reason for the open source cluster version. Only open source products can be rolled into stronger product power. For example, the technical feature of cluster will naturally attract developers (and the cluster itself is The product of our community collaboration) will attract more users and contributors to use feedback and iterate together. The community drives and then positively promotes open source projects and satisfies user functional experience.\\nAs for open source commercialization, the premise of open source commercialization is to have a really good, popular, and widely used open source product, and then do commercialization on this basis to make money.\\n\\n### Install quickly via docker\\n\\n1.

Major release. HertzBeat v1.3.2 has published.   \\n\\n**This delightful version came out of the hard work of 27 friends. Thank them! Love \ud83d\udc97**\\n\\nIn this version, we support new monitoring types and metrics for **freebsd, debian, opensuse, redhat, apache doris**, etc.\\n\\n- Support WEB page configuration mail server, replace the previous file configuration\\n- Supports alarm convergence. If repeated alarms are frequently sent, it will be resolved immediately with alarm convergence\\n- The public message queue supports Kafka. In addition to our default built-in memory message queue, it also supports an external Kafka message queue to improve system performance.\\n- The new monitoring center page aggregates all monitoring types, no need to switch back and forth like before.\\n- Support label group display, group and mark monitors of the same business category for unified management.\\n- Threshold configuration not only has expressions, but also supports a more user-friendly operation UI.

Done! It doesn\'t require us to deploy agents or various cumbersome operations, isn\'t it very simple**\\n\\n- **Just one step to configure the IP port on the HertzBeat monitoring page and add SpringBoot2 application monitoring**\\n\\n\\n:::tip\\nThrough the above, we have completed the monitoring of the SpringBoot2 application. We can check the status and availability of various metrics of the SpringBoot2 application at any time in HertzBeat.  \\nOf course, it is impossible to manually check the metrics in real time. Monitoring is often accompanied by alarm thresholds. When the performance metrics of the SpringBoot2 application exceed our threshold or the SpringBoot2 application itself is abnormal, we can promptly notify our corresponding person in charge. The person in charge receives the notification and handles it. , this is a complete monitoring and alarm process.\\n:::\\n\\n**Next, we will demonstrate step by step how to configure the threshold alarm notification in the HertzBeat system. When the metrics of the SpringBoot2 application are abnormal, we will be notified in time**  \\n\\n#### 3. Add SpringBoot2 application metric threshold alarm in HertzBeat system\\n\\n1. Configure an alarm threshold for an important metric\\n\\nPath: Menu -> Threshold Rules -> Add Threshold\\n\\n- Select the configured metric object. SpringBoot2 application monitoring mainly focuses on stack memory threads and other related metrics. For example, we set the threshold for the metric `threads` -> `threads`. When the number of threads in the `runnable` state is greater than At 300 an alert is issued.\\n- Here we configure to send an alarm when `size`, `state` of `equals(state, \\"runnable\\"\\") && size>300` of this metric, the alarm level is **warning alarm**, which will be triggered three times, specifically As shown below.\\n\\n![hertzbeat](/img/blog/monitor-springboot2-6.png)\\n\\n![hertzbeat](/img/blog/monitor-springboot2-7.png)\\n\\n\\n2. Add message notification recipients\\n\\n> Configure the receiver to let the alarm message know who to send and how to send it.\\n\\nPath: Menu -> Alarm Notification -> Alarm Recipient -> Add New Recipient\\n\\nMessage notification methods support **email, DingTalk, WeChat Work, Feishu, WebHook, SMS**, etc. Here we take the commonly used DingTalk as an example.\\n\\n- Refer to this [Help Documentation](https://hertzbeat.com/docs/help/alert_dingtalk) https://hertzbeat.com/docs/help/alert_dingtalk to configure the robot on DingTalk and set the security custom keyword `HertzBeat `, get the corresponding `access_token` value.\\n- Configure the receiver parameters in HertzBeat as follows.\\n\\n\u3010Alarm Notification\u3011->\u3010New Recipient\u3011->\u3010Select DingTalk Robot Notification Method\u3011->\u3010Set DingTalk Robot ACCESS_TOKEN\u3011->\u3010OK\u3011\\n\\n![hertzbeat](/img/blog/alert-notice-1.png)\\n\\n3. Configure the associated alarm notification strategy \u26a0\ufe0f [Add notification strategy] -> [Associate the recipient just set] -> [OK]\\n\\n> Configure the alarm notification policy to bind the alarm message with the receiver, so that you can decide which alarms to send to whom.\\n\\n![hertzbeat](/img/blog/alert-notice-2.png)\\n\\n\\n### Finished, now wait for the warning message to come. ding ding ding ding\\n\\n```\\n[HertzBeat warning notification]\\nAlarm target object: springboot2.threads.size\\nAffiliated monitoring ID: 483783444839322\\nBelonging monitoring name: SPRINGBOOT2_localhost\\nAlarm level: warning alarm\\nAlarm trigger time: 2023-03-22 21:13:44\\nContent details: The springboot2 service\'s runnable state threads num is over 300, now is 444.\\n```\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\n:::tip\\nThis practical article took us to experience how to use the open source real-time monitoring tool HertzBeat to monitor SpringBoot2 application metric data. We can find that HertzBeat, which integrates `monitoring-alarm-notification`, is more convenient in operation and use, just click a little on the page The SpringBoot2 application can be included in the monitoring and alarm notification, and the tedious operations of deploying multiple components and writing configuration files are no longer needed.\\n:::\\n\\n> Only one docker command is needed to install and experience heartbeat:\\n\\n`docker run -d -p 1157:1157 --name hertzbeat tancloud/hertzbeat`\\n\\n## More powerful\\n\\n> Through the simple steps above, we have realized the monitoring of SpringBoot2, but the built-in metrics in it do not meet the needs. Can we customize and monitor more metrics of SpringBoot2? The answer is of course yes, through **Monitoring Definition**->**SpringBoot2** on the page, you can customize and modify the performance metrics you want to monitor by editing the following YML configuration file at any time.\\n\\n![hertzbeat](/img/blog/monitor-springboot2-8.png)\\n\\n## What is HertzBeat?\\n\\n> [HertzBeat](https://github.com/dromara/hertzbeat) is an open source, real-time monitoring tool with custom-monitor and agentless.       \\n> **Monitor+Alerter+Notify** all in one.

Adding Threshold Alerts for DynamicTp Thread Pool Metrics in HertzBeat System\\n\\n1. Configure an alarm threshold for an important metric.\\n\\nPath: Menu -> Alert Thresholds -> Add Thresholds\\n\\n- DynamicTp monitors some thread pool related metrics, for example, we set the threshold for the `run_timeout_count` `thread_pool_running` -> `run_timeout_count` metric, which will raise an alarm when the thread_timeout_count is greater than one.\\n- Here we configure an alert to be issued when `thread_pool_running` has a `run_timeout_count>1`, with an alert level of **Serious Alert**, which is triggered three times, as shown in the following figure.\\n\\n![hertzbeat](/img/blog/monitor-dynamic-tp-6.png)\\n\\n\\n2. Add message notification recipients\\n\\n> Configure recipients to let alert message know who to send to and in what way.\\n\\nPath: Menu -> Alert Notification -> Alert Recipient -> Add Recipient.\\n\\nMessage notification methods support **Email, Dingtalk, WeChat, Flybook, WebHook, SMS**, etc. We take the commonly used Dingtalk as an example.\\n\\n- Refer to this [help document](https://hertzbeat.com/docs/help/alert_dingtalk) https://hertzbeat.com/docs/help/alert_dingtalk Configure the bot on Dingtalk side, set the security customization keyword ` HertzBeat`, get the corresponding `access_token` value.\\n- Configure the recipient parameters in HertzBeat as follows.\\n\\n[Alert Notification] -> [Add Recipient] -> [Choose Dingtalk bot notification method] -> [Set Dingtalk bot ACCESS_TOKEN] -> [OK]\\n\\n![hertzbeat](/img/blog/alert-notice-1.png)\\n\\n3. Configure the associated alert notification policy \u26a0\ufe0f [Add Notification Policy] -> [Associate the recipient you just set] -> [OK] !\\n\\n> Configure the alert notification policy to bind alert messages to recipients so that you can decide which alerts go to which person.\\n\\n![hertzbeat](/img/blog/alert-notice-2.png)\\n\\n\\n### Over and out, now wait for the alert message to come through. Ding, ding, ding, ding.\\n\\n```\\n[HertzBeat alert notification]\\nAlert target object : dynamic_tp.thread_pool_running.run_timeout_count\\nTask ID : 205540620349493\\nTask Name : dynamic_tp_localhost\\nAlarm Level : Critical Alarm\\nAlarm Trigger Time : 2023-02-02 22:17:06\\nDetails : DynamicTp has run timeout thread, count is 2\\n```\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\n:::tip\\nThis practical article takes us to experience how to use HertzBeat to monitor DynamicTp thread pool metrics data, and we can find that HertzBeat with ``monitoring-alerting-notification`` is much more convenient to operate and use, and you only need to point and click on a page to include DynamicTp thread pool into the monitoring and alert notification, and you don\'t need to deploy multiple components to write YML configuration files anymore.

Add message notification recipients\\n\\n> Configure recipients to let alert message know who to send to and in what way.\\n\\nPath: Menu -> Alert Notification -> Alert Recipients -> Add New Recipient.\\n\\nMessage notification methods support **Email, Nail, WeChat, Flybook, WebHook, SMS**, etc. Here we take the commonly used Nail as an example.\\n\\n- Refer to this [help document](https://hertzbeat.com/docs/help/alert_dingtalk) https://hertzbeat.com/docs/help/alert_dingtalk Configure the bot on the pinning side, set the security customization keyword ` HertzBeat`, get the corresponding `access_token` value.\\n- Configure the recipient parameters in HertzBeat as follows.\\n\\n[Alert Notification] -> [Add Recipient] -> [Select Nailed Bot Notification Method] -> [Set Nailed Bot ACCESS_TOKEN] -> [OK]\\n\\n![hertzbeat](/img/blog/alert-notice-1.png)\\n\\n3. Configure the associated alert notification policy \u26a0\ufe0f [Add Notification Policy] -> [Associate the recipient you just set] -> [OK] !\\n\\n> Configure the alert notification policy to bind alert messages to recipients so that you can decide which alerts go to which person.\\n\\n![hertzbeat](/img/blog/alert-notice-2.png)\\n\\n\\n### Over and out, now wait for the alert message to come through. Ding, ding, ding, ding.\\n\\n```\\n[HertzBeat Alert Notification]\\nAlert target object : shenyu.process_open_fds.value\\nTask ID : 205540620349696\\nTask name : SHENYU_localhost\\nAlarm level : Warning alarm\\nAlarm Trigger Time : 2023-01-08 22:17:06\\nDetails : Please note that the number of file descriptors opened by \u26a0\ufe0f ShenYu gateway is 3044 more than 3000\\n```\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\n:::tip\\nThis hands-on article takes us through how to use HertzBeat to monitor Apache ShenYu metrics data, and we can find that HertzBeat, which combines ``Monitoring-Alert-Notification``, is much more convenient to operate and use, and you can include ShenYu in the monitoring by simply clicking on a page. There is no need to deploy multiple components and write multiple YML configuration files.  \\n:::\\n\\nApache ShenYu Github: https://github.com/apache/shenyu        \\nHertzBeat Github: https://github.com/dromara/hertzbeat\\n\\n**Welcome to learn about using Star Support Oh! **\\n\\nExperience heartbeat with a single docker command:   \\n`docker run -d -p 1157:1157 --name hertzbeat tancloud/hertzbeat`"},{"id":"/2023/01/05/monitor-iotdb","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/01/05/monitor-iotdb","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/hertzbeat/edit/master/home/blog/2023-01-05-monitor-iotdb.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-01-05-monitor-iotdb.md","title":"Use HertzBeat Monitoring IoTDB","description":"Use HertzBeat to monitor the Internet of Things database IoTDB, and it will be done in 5 minutes!","date":"2023-01-05T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 5, 2023","tags":[{"label":"opensource","permalink":"/blog/tags/opensource"},{"label":"practice","permalink":"/blog/tags/practice"}],"readingTime":4.635,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"tom","title":"tom","url":"https://github.com/tomsun28","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24788200?s=400&v=4"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Use HertzBeat Monitoring IoTDB","author":"tom","author_title":"tom","author_url":"https://github.com/tomsun28","author_image_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24788200?s=400&v=4","tags":["opensource","practice"]},"prevItem":{"title":"HertzBeat\'s Monitoring Practice for API Gateway Apache ShenYu","permalink":"/blog/2023/01/08/monitor-shenyu"},"nextItem":{"title":"HertzBeat v1.2.3\uff01Support Prometheus,ShenYu and IotDb","permalink":"/blog/2022/12/28/hertzbeat-v1.2.3"}},"content":"## Use HertzBeat to monitor the Internet of Things database IoTDB, and it will be done in 5 minutes!\\n\\n### Introduction to IoTDB\\n\\n> Apache IoTDB (Internet of Things Database) is a time-series database management system that can provide users with data collection, storage and analysis services.\\n> Due to its lightweight architecture, high performance and high availability, and seamless integration with Hadoop and Spark ecosystems, IoTDB meets the requirements of massive data storage, high-throughput data writing, and complex data query and analysis in the industrial IoT field. need.\\n\\n### Introduction to HertzBeat\\n\\n> HertzBeat is an open source, easy-to-use and friendly real-time monitoring tool that does not require Agent and has powerful custom monitoring capabilities.\\n> Supports monitoring of application services, databases, operating systems, middleware, cloud native, etc., threshold alarms, and alarm notifications (email WeChat Dingding Feishu).\\n> HertzBeat\'s powerful customization, multi-type support, easy expansion, and low coupling hope to help developers and small and medium teams quickly build their own monitoring tools.\\n\\n### Get monitoring IoTDB in HertzBeat in 5 minutes\\n\\n#### Prerequisites, you already have IoTDB environment and HertzBeat environment.\\n\\n- IoTDB [deployment and installation documentation](https://iotdb.apache.org/UserGuide/V0.13.x/QuickStart/QuickStart.html)\\n- HertzBeat [deployment installation documentation](https://hertzbeat.com/docs/start/docker-deploy)\\n\\n#### 1. Enable the `metrics` function on the IoTDB side, which will provide interface data in the form of prometheus metrics.\\n\\n1. The metric collection is disabled by default, you need to modify the parameters in `conf/iotdb-metric.yml` first, then restart the server\\n```\\n# Whether to start the monitoring module, the default is false\\nenableMetric: true\\n\\n# Data provision method, externally provide metrics data through jmx and prometheus protocol, optional parameters: [JMX, PROMETHEUS, IOTDB], IOTDB is closed by default.\\nmetricReporterList:\\n   - JMX\\n   - PROMETHEUS\\n```\\n\\n2. Restart IoTDB, open a browser or use curl to access http://ip:9091/metrics, and you can see the metric data.\\n\\n#### 2. Add IoTDB monitoring on the HertzBeat monitoring page\\n\\n1. Click Add IoTDB Monitoring\\n\\nPath: Menu -> Database Monitoring -> IoTDB Monitoring -> Add IoTDB Monitoring\\n\\n![hertzbeat](/img/blog/monitor-iotdb-1.png)\\n\\n2. Configure the parameters required for monitoring IoTDB\\n\\nFill in the IoTDB **service IP** and **monitoring port** (default 9091) on the monitoring page, and finally click OK to add.\\nFor other parameters such as **collection interval**, **timeout period**, etc., please refer to [Help Documentation](https://hertzbeat.com/docs/help/iotdb/) https://hertzbeat.com/docs/help /iotdb/\\n\\n![hertzbeat](/img/blog/monitor-iotdb-2.png)\\n\\n3. Complete \u2705, now we have added the monitoring of IoTDB, check the monitoring list to see our added items.\\n\\n![hertzbeat](/img/blog/monitor-iotdb-3.png)\\n\\n4. Click **Operation**->**Monitoring Details Icon** of the monitoring list item to browse the real-time monitoring metric data of IoTDB.\\n\\n![hertzbeat](/img/blog/monitor-iotdb-4.png)\\n\\n5. Click **Monitoring History Details TAB** to browse IoTDB\'s historical monitoring metric data chart\ud83d\udcc8.\\n\\n![hertzbeat](/img/blog/monitor-iotdb-5.png)\\n\\n**Complete DONE! Through the above steps, it is actually two steps to sum up**\\n- **Enable `metrics` function on IoTDB in one step**\\n- **Another step is to configure the IP port on the HertzBeat monitoring page to add monitoring**\\n\\n\\n**In this way, we have completed the monitoring of IoTDB. We can view the monitoring details and metrics at any time to observe its service status, but people cannot always watch it. When there is always a time to rest, monitoring is often accompanied by alarms. When monitoring When the metrics are abnormal, the monitoring tool needs to be able to notify the person in charge in time**\\n\\n**Next, we will teach you step by step to configure the threshold alarm notification in the HertzBeat system**\\n\\n#### 3. Add IoTDB metric threshold alarm in HertzBeat system\\n\\n1. Configure a threshold alarm for an important metric\\n\\nPath: Menu -> Alarm Threshold -> Add Threshold\\n\\n- Select the configured metric object. IotDB monitors many metrics, one of which is related to the status of the node `cluster_node_status` -> `status` (node status, 1=online 2=offline).\\n- Here we configure to send an alarm when the metric `status==2`, the alarm level is **Critical Alarm**, which is triggered once, as shown in the figure below.\\n\\n![hertzbeat](/img/blog/monitor-iotdb-6.png)\\n\\n\\n2. Add message notification recipients\\n\\nPath: Menu -> Alarm Notification -> Alarm Recipient -> Add New Recipient\\n\\nMessage notification methods support **email, DingTalk, WeChat Work, Feishu, WebHook, SMS**, etc. Here we take the commonly used DingTalk as an example.\\n\\n- Refer to this [Help Documentation](https://hertzbeat.com/docs/help/alert_dingtalk) https://hertzbeat.com/docs/help/alert_dingtalk to configure the robot on DingTalk and set the security custom keyword `HertzBeat `, get the corresponding `access_token` value.\\n- Configure the receiver parameters in HertzBeat as follows.\\n\\n\u3010Alarm Notification\u3011->\u3010New Recipient\u3011->\u3010Select DingTalk Robot Notification Method\u3011->\u3010Set DingTalk Robot ACCESS_TOKEN\u3011->\u3010OK\u3011\\n\\n![hertzbeat](/img/blog/alert-notice-1.png)\\n\\n3. Configure the associated alarm notification strategy \u26a0\ufe0f [Add notification strategy] -> [Associate the recipient just set] -> [OK]\\n\\n![hertzbeat](/img/blog/alert-notice-2.png)\\n\\n\\n### Finished, now wait for the warning message to come. ding ding ding ding\\n\\n```\\n[HertzBeat warning notification]\\nAlarm target object: iotdb.cluster_node_status.status\\nAffiliated monitoring ID: 205540620349696\\nBelonging monitoring name: IOTDB_localhost\\nAlarm level: critical alarm\\nAlarm trigger time: 2023-01-05 22:17:06\\nContent details: The status of IOTDB node 127.0.0.1 is monitored as OFFLINE, please deal with it in time.\\n```\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nThis practical article took us to experience that if HertzBeat is used to monitor the IoTDB database metric data, we can find that HertzBeat, which integrates monitoring-alarm-notification, is more convenient in operation and use, and IoTDB can be included in the monitoring with a simple click on the page, it is no longer necessary to deploy multiple components and write multiple YML configuration files with thresholds.\\n\\nIoTDB Github: https://github.com/apache/iotdb\\nHertzBeat Github: https://github.com/dromara/hertzbeat\\n\\n**Welcome to learn about using Star Support! **\\n\\nOnly one docker command is needed to install and experience heartbeat:\\n`docker run -d -p 1157:1157 --name hertzbeat tancloud/hertzbeat`\\n\\nNote \u26a0\ufe0fHertzBeat v1.2.3 version supports IoTDB v0.12 v0.13.
