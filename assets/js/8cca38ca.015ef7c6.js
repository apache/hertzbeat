In the second half of the 19th century, it resisted the invaders who invaded their territory. In order to show respect for this Indian tribe, the name of the tribe (Apache) is used as the server name.\nBut when it comes to this naming, there is an interesting story circulating here. Because this server is based on the NCSA HTTPd server and is the product of continuous revision and patching through the efforts of everyone, it is nicknamed "A Patchy Server" (a patch server).
